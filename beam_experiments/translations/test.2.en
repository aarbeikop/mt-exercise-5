A few years ago , Peter Skillman has shown here at TED, a design competition .
The marshmallow-challenged .
And the idea is pretty simple : Grepearing four of the work with 20 of spaghetti , a meaning of spaghetti , a massive , and a marshmallowed .
The marshmallow mallow to the marshmallow .
And even though it turns out , it turns out , it turns out , because this assignment people are going to work together because this assignment people to work together .
And because I decided this is an interesting idea , I decided to take it in a design work-shopping it in a design work-shopped .
And it was a big successful .
Since then , I &apos;ve done this exercise in about 70 design workshops around the world with exercise , designers and engineering , and even with Fortune of Fortune , 50-company .
And this exercise gives us deep insights in how people collaboratory , and I want to department a few of you .
Normally , the first step people are having on the case that people on the case .
She &apos;s resources for how it &apos;s going to play , play power .
Then they &apos;re going to planners .
They &apos;re sketches and monstruggling .
The biggest part of the time they built work on the spaghettes of spaghettes .
And at the end , when time , it &apos;s almost for somebody packs the marshmallow them to do a bunch of it , put a bunch back up on top , and Taaake !
They admire their tool .
But what &apos;s really going to happen , most of the master is that the amazing providing of the realm of the marshmallow for the entire construction of the marshmallow for the entire construction and collapse .
Now , the people have more of that extraordinary extraordinary measures more than other .
And what of the worst has been studied with a MBA.
They &apos;re playing , they play , and they &apos;re going to make sure , and they make sure employment .
And besides there are a meaning of the task that a lot more of the excellent .
And at the best of them have just been graduated column .
That &apos;s a impressive .
And Peter tells , they &apos;re not just making the highest building .
So , what you &apos;re going to ask , how do you get to do that ? What do that ?
Peters answer issue , it &apos;s a Gone of the children &apos;s boss to be the boss of Spagency BV.V.
They don &apos;t waste time with power games .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And that &apos;s it that economists have to finish the only right thing for the most of the extraordinary right now .
And then they go out that out .
But what &apos;s happening , when they were the marshmallow the marshmallow is that they don &apos;t greed time . And dance ?
It &apos;s a disaster .
Clounds sound , certainly ?
And what &apos;s going to do is a little bit different --
is that they with the marshmallow initial .
They build prototyping prototype , and new prototyping
and the marshmallow upper , so they have more opportunity to repair .
Designers remember this processes as the basis of an iterative processes .
At the children , the metaneously , the children get a feedback about what it is not going to work .
So , the building prototypes is very important .
But let &apos;s see how different teams the door .
The average for the mediately for 50 cmill .
economists there are half ,
Two , better than the extraction .
Who does it spend ?
chitects and engineering , happily .
The highest building that I &apos;ve seen was a high-legacy .
And what &apos;s the extremely retilate , and self-rement measuring geometric structures are the key to building stable to build stable towards stable to build stable calculture .
CEOr , a little better than average .
But now it becomes interesting , if you get a secretary at the team , they &apos;re going to get a secretary .
Incredible . You can see the team and think-to-based wind .
And that can you visit in . And value ?
although they are good at support to support .
They &apos;re managency to understand the processes .
And every team that &apos;s good revenue and attention for the work is going to be the performance of that team is good comentable .
And specialized and supportive skills lead to a successful .
If you normally get 10 teams to do this , there will be a massive to be a massive work .
And I tried to try something interesting .
I thought , we make it a little exciting .
So I was going to walk on the winning teams of wind from winning teams .
And what do you think these designers are definitely exactly ?
What happened ?
The next ones .
No single team had built a state .
And it &apos;s been an inch of catch , a centimetered , was enough to get to price .
And it &apos;s a more properly insistences a higher insistences .
We have the exercise repeately with the exercise .
And what do you think about that then ?
So they now understand the prototypes .
And this team changed the worst team in one of the bad team in one of the bee .
They made the highest built in the least .
So that &apos;s a good lesson for us about the nature of reward and successful .
You might ask , you may be saying , &quot; Why would somebody want to spend time to spend a marshmallow-challenge ?
The reason , I work on making digital tools and processes to help in building teams and to help teams in the building of car makes sense of car and visual effectively .
And the marshmallow-challenge helps them to come back the hidden assumption .
Do , honest , honest project has its own marshmallowed , nothing ?
And the challenge is a given an experiencing the empathy of the employed prototype .
And so that &apos;s the value of the experience of this so realization .
And for a sense of interests , instead , go to marshmallowchallenge .
On this blog , you can see how to build the mashmallows .
And there are stacking structions .
There are preview of how people around the world have tricks and adaptation .
There are also a world records .
And the fundamental lesson , think , really design a contacts .
It &apos;s the protein of all our senses , and that we use our best thinks , feeling and exploring for the challenge that our lightforward for us .
And sometimes a small prototype prototype of this experience to make sense of the ade-mal-to-having a massive moment in a case of mind .
And that makes a big differently .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s just assume that we have a machine , a big machine , a big machine , a major machine , a major inequipment , and it &apos;s still a time machine .
And everybody here has to involve .
You can get in the time or forward in the time , but not here and it &apos;s now .
I &apos;m genty what you would choose , because I &apos;ve asked this question all kinds of friends , and they all want to go back .
They all want to go back to the time before authority of Twitter or Twitter or Twitter , for the meaning of American extendency .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s a certain hang of nostallel , to state .
And I can come in there .
But I don &apos;t hear there , I &apos;ve got to say that .
I don &apos;t want to return back , and not because I &apos;m so adventure -- but for the potential of these planetary .
They &apos;re not going to go forward , who are going forward .
So I want to go in the case , and I want to go forward in the time .
And we live in the violent time on this planet on what area , but what area , richness , riches , cansensorities , disease , disease of disease .
Never was a time as desea .
And my grandparents are all the time of 60s .
My grandparents were all 70s .
And my parents are already at the 800s .
So , I &apos;ll get a piece in the 90 feet .
But it &apos;s not just about under .
There &apos;s a lot more on the game .
And a kid in New Delhi is born in New Delhi has a life-expectancy , in the world , 100 years .
Think about that . That &apos;s an incredible facts .
And why is it true ?
The smallpox . The smallpox are people on this planet of life .
They had an influence on the demography of this world bigger than any war .
But they &apos;re not multimate . They &apos;re floating .
We &apos;ve overwhelmed them . Pof!
In the wealthy world disease , which is a generation of millions of people threatened , as good as not multiple .
Diftery , rodehond-grade ,
somebody here still know what that that ?
Inentiny , modern medicine our possibilities to supply for the argument , all are triumph to support of scientific method .
And for me , is the scientific method , trying to figure out whether it works , and it works and nonetheless , one of the biggest enormental lots .
That &apos;s the good news .
But I &apos;m sorry enough to say that the only good news because there are some other problems , they call it a lot of other problems , and it &apos;s date for all of our resources , there &apos;s still a date of the wildlife , there &apos;s still a wildly affected people in this global every day .
Their number of takes , and it takes sense , and it &apos;s a challenge .
And not just date , we also have our imagination to pollutting the world &apos;s resources .
Drinkable waterfront agrony , rainforest , gas: they &apos;re disappearance , and if we &apos;re not able to be able to innovation from this mismaterial , also will we &apos;re gone .
The question is : Can we have this question .
And I think it &apos;s clear that we are able to make sure for the realization of the argument without the country we live to putterly .
I think we can see these world of energy forms that are not in the realm of energizes .
I believe that eventure , needly , that &apos;s not a wish of knowledge .
But now , I think that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to wake up at night -- one of the things that I woke up at night .
Never we have been so dependent on scientific progression , necessarily , and never we &apos;re able to make sure that we have been able to make of use today .
We &apos;re on the threshot of the most amazing advantage of the most amazing thing .
And I think we really have to say that hundreds of jarency , say , 300 years , to find a time of the Ulightning , to find a time of the United States , to find this innovations that we are heart these incurate stick , and fought in areas .
People hang their faith spot with such a thing that it &apos;s almost impossible to make them of it ,
And listening , everybody has right on his own mental ; everybody has even got the right on a mindset of what the examples , but you don &apos;t know where you don &apos;t have a straight on the right ?
You don &apos;t have a straight on your own facts . Neading your own facts .
And I &apos;ve done a while about it to realize that .
A teen years ago , I wrote a story about inenting for The New York City , for a very short .
I was amazingly underneath , against what in fact , the most effective measurely for the public health of history .
And I didn &apos;t know what I do , so I wrote a story and I went on .
A little bit later , I wrote a story of genetically depleasure .
With the self-de, but it turns worse .
People are challenge .
So I wrote there , but a story , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people who understand this is a frankly for the meaning of moleculate , why they thought that the deavy of molecules on a focused on the nature .
Mear , I know , I &apos;m doing what I wrote . I wrote a story and I was about until the day . I &apos;m journalism ; we &apos;re going to do it , we &apos;re going to eat and that is date .
But these stories are benefore me , I couldn &apos;t make it extremely realized .
And because the fanaticians who made me crazy me , in fact , no fanaticians .
And they were well-education , good subject .
just like the people in this business .
And it was just that what me was so solid .
but then frowd , I know , let &apos;s just be honest : We are at a moment in this world that we &apos;re not going to have to make such a meaning of mind .
And we &apos;re talking about two-lit .
We &apos;re talking about it as between the history .
Take a vancement of the reality .
OK, there are reasons , and I think we also know that we know them .
And we &apos;re lengthroughout in institutions , and in science , in science , and there is no reason why no reason why no reason .
You only have to drop a couple of names and understand people .
Tshjernobyl, Bhope , the Challenge , Viox, mass destruction destruction , not good performed ponto mass excited , not good ponent map on skin tendency .
I mean , you can see your list themselves .
There are questions and problems with those people that we thought they always equally eath .
So , you &apos;re skeptics .
Now , imagine , ask prove and evidence of the alone , you don &apos;t just want anything .
But now , if you get evidence , then you have to take them , and you have to get them to be so good .
And the reason I can say that is that we &apos;re now in an unprecently angstep that we hope that they &apos;re going to be going to be left as possible .
About 12 years , there was a horrible story published that a connected between the epidemic of autism and the instance against major and the inenting against majority .
Angsting .
And hopefully studies expressed to go or this true .
And that &apos;s a very severe seekend .
And the data came up .
She found in the United States , in English , in Swedish , in Cand, and in Cand, and all the result , not at least .
But it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter because we think of anecdotes, we believe what we think and what we think about and what we think , and what we think we really think .
We can &apos;t believe a belief of a bunch of an official government that we all of data on the disease , and I can come in there in the next , and I think we all that art .
But you know water ?
The consequences were catastrophic , and it &apos;s about this : The United States are one of the world in the world where the number of intings against the majority of the majority and collaboratory .
That &apos;s a shake , and we should have to collect our damage .
It &apos;s a terrible .
What &apos;s going to do with us that we could decide to decide that we could decide it ?
And I understand what I understand .
Who is going to get mazingly easy ?
Have anybody of this audience ever see anybody &apos;s going to die of mazingly ?
Don &apos;t often head .
And here &apos;s not multiple , but it happened last year , 160,000 times in the world .
That &apos;s a lot of killed by maze , 20 per hour .
But because it &apos;s not going to be here , we can involve the relatively and people like Jenny McCarthy , and of anxiety Keeealized and inscience in extraordinary things like Oprah and Larry King .
And they can do that because they can &apos;t make a distinct between ordinary and accidental condition of circumstances .
They don &apos;t really understand that these things like , but it &apos;s practical practical .
And that &apos;s something that we need to learn and that we need to teach , and that we need to teach some of the existence .
This guy was a clear , Jonas Salki.
It &apos;s a dealing of one of our worst .
Not an anxiety , no death multiple messages . Polios , putting .
That guy in the middle , too .
It &apos;s called Paul Offith .
He developed a variety of the clip against the clip of the mental mental .
The rescued the lives of such as 400,000 to 500,000 kids in the third world .
Good , right ?
Well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul threatened to talk about various realm and how valuable they &apos;re sending .
and that people should be able to keep in order to keep jams .
And so he says it &apos;s the eye .
So Paul is a terrorist .
If he &apos;s a public deallows than it can only be in resembling .
He gets home phones because there are people who are price to say they know where his children are lying out there to be children .
And what about what Paul has been doing is that Paul has developed .
I don &apos;t have to say it , but I don &apos;t need to be unreceived .
Take them , take the diseases will return terrible disease , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
We have returned into this country .
And it &apos;s going to be reverted short , again , when children go die , if there &apos;s enough disease .
And they will not only be easy and killing .
What about smallpolice . Why none ?
And a former fellow employed me to wrote , and said she said , &quot; She said , &quot; She said , &quot; She was going to be released .
No one has ever sleeval me that ever hit me .
She wasn &apos;t replicate her child .
In no case .
Good .
What &apos;s the meaning is that we don &apos;t have a position . And you know watch ?
Yesterday , polio didn &apos;t prevent anymore .
More , I think , of course , because of the wetorrow , maybe somebody on an aircraft in Los Angeler , he &apos;s now above right now .
Within a couple hours , a car , and it comes to Long , for Long , for the meaning of the amazing thing that amazing dinner .
And he doesn &apos;t realize that he is with a paralyzes , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s the date .
That &apos;s the planet for us .
We rather tackling in the gang .
Have everyone tomorrow are vitamences smart ?
Echinacadequate a bit of an axide for the day ?
I know because half the Americans every day .
They &apos;re allowing it , and they use alternative drug , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we discovering that they need to realize that they value .
The data is always reinforces again .
They make your urine dark . And they never practical .
OK , if you want to spend 28 dollars for dark urin , Dan , you know , you know , Dan &apos;s just sweet .
Dark . Doncertainly .
Why do we do that ? I think I understanding it , we hate Big Pharmation .
We hate the government . We &apos;re hate that police .
That &apos;s needs to be our healthcare reward-provide .
They are for millions of our country .
They &apos;re amazing heart root , and they even dequate even for those of us that they can permiterent .
So , we walk away from away , and where we walk up ?
We &apos;re in the arms of Big Placeboard .
Damazing . I love Big Placeboard .
Mear , this is very , very , because the entire mundane , and we give it to extent , and we give it for the argumber dollars .
I &apos;ve got a few of those things here .
Gink , chinacaim , chinacai , I don &apos;t even know what that isn , but we &apos;re giving it to be the argument of the argument , all of them .
And you know water ? If I tell the people against me to call the people against me , and they say , what can you get a little bit of a scale ? Let the people .
They feel good about it .
And you know water ? You &apos;re wrong .
I mean , it can &apos;t care about whether it &apos;s the secretary of the health service service that &apos;s setttelling to me , a human-to-to-meeting mmography for a memmammographs of the experts of mammography
or the other cancer cancer that are seal-zero cancer .
And if you start to replace evidence and science by believable and magic than you don &apos;t have to come out .
Then you get in the South Africa of Thabo Mkidding Africa .
He &apos;s responsible for 400,000 people of his people who are being able to death , that babroots , button and quote , button and quote messages the resources that can train AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of non-thousands of nation in a country that has been planted by this disease .
I don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t tell me that these things .
They have .
Now , the most thoughtful epidemic of the epidemic of the support of genetic existence of genetically messages and the organic progress .
It &apos;s an idisease . It &apos;s got to stop .
It &apos;s going to be various .
It &apos;s ideology , no science .
Everything that we cut , every single of richness , every single thing is extremely every single thing , is because of humanizing .
Now , if you don &apos;t think there in the employment of all the time is not a mandards of warently mandards .
It didn &apos;t exist any water meloent .
Even no Christbs bomb . They all come from ourselves .
And we &apos;re looking at them in the last 1,000 jarently .
Some of those products bar and others were having the neat .
We &apos;re not exploring us of what we &apos;re discovered .
Now , we can do a little bit more regulately .
En, certainty , there are risks to connection .
But we can produce rice to produce millions of producing millions of life and longer .
You don &apos;t want to address ?
I have to handle it , I don &apos;t understand .
We don &apos;t want genetic modified .
And what about what ?
Well , this is the entire time : too many chemicals , a pesticidental , monoculary , monocultural , monoculary , we don &apos;t want to be a right-wing fields of the awashing , for days .
We don &apos;t like companies that take patents of living on lives .
We don &apos;t want that companies the property rights on seed .
And you know what I answered on that ?
You have a similar . Let &apos;s downtown .
It &apos;s value . Our problem is overwhelmed , but that &apos;s not a science .
It has nothing to do with science .
This is going to be legitians , morality , patently patent .
Science is not a society .
No language .
Even no ideas . It &apos;s a processional .
It &apos;s a proces, and sometimes it works and sometimes .
But the idea that we have to heat the science of doing it because we &apos;re afraid to do her work , because we &apos;re really afraid and will heat millions of people to heat to any sense of the argument .
Weat jump , in the next 50 years , we will need more to 70percent more requires than moving .
70 prostate .
This is a graph , the distance of the investment in Africa for the last 30 year .
Schandalgards .
They really need it , and we remember the hengering .
And the reason ? Genetical public realization .
We don &apos;t want people to be a minority as a cassave example , as a cassave examples .
Cassave is the daily afford of a half a mental mental to be a meaning of a meaningful member .
It &apos;s just a lot of calory .
It &apos;s not enough for protein , it &apos;s not enough for protein , and scientists have been doing something about that .
almost people can eat that without blind .
They wouldn &apos;t heat anymore , and you know water ?
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t cute heart , but it would be fine .
And all I have to say , &quot; Why are we display ?
I mean , let &apos;s say , why do we remember ?
that we don &apos;t want to shelter ?
This is going to be transmitted with chemicals . Have nothing to do with chemicals .
Also , not with our ridiculous passion for hormonths , our desire to multiply , better and special event .
It &apos;s not about Rice Krief , it &apos;s about people in life .
and it &apos;s about to understand that we want to start to understand what that is going .
Now , the thing you know watching ?
If we don &apos;t do it and continuous as we are going to be able to do it , we &apos;re written to something that we don &apos;t want to be bully to be : a mind tech colonialization .
I don &apos;t think that any other way to describe this better .
It &apos;s self-size and longer , our indigames , and we need to really do something about it .
So after this unimaginable resource , maybe you &apos;d like to say , you &apos;d like to say , with this ridiculous timeless of travel .
Absolute , I want to date date .
Now , they &apos;re still in the potential , but we have an amazing probabilities .
We can do it for all that time for all we want to use .
We can bring them to a meaning that we want , and we &apos;re going to bring them to where we wild .
We have to continue with these appropriate , and we need to keep nasty , but if we &apos;re going to keep and forward , we &apos;ll be happy to be happy .
I know that we have the artistic , and that , for me , to me , something that &apos;s got to science .
Thank you .
Thank you .
A columnist of the Los Angeles Times--
Steve Lopezy , walking on a day ...
through the center of Los Angelescape
when he heard music .
It came from a male .
A black male .
Charter , label label , homeless .
And it &apos;s pretty much on a violent , but two string .
I &apos;m telling to tell you something that many of you all science
because the columns of Steve the basic ...
for a view of a movie .
Robert Downey Jrinney : the role of Steve Lopeza ,
and Jamie Foxx who of Nathony Ayers...
the classic contrast ,
that are more likely to recognize career ,
because he was suffering to paranoid shifts .
Nathanel stopped with the Juilliard-conservatory , length --
And 30 years later , he swiring homeless .
because of the poorest streets of Los Angelestimate .
You should read Stemporary , you should read the movie .
Next just for the beautiful band-...
that died between these two male .
But also to see which role music playful music .
a instrumental role , if I say that I say ,
to Nathaniel from the street .
I met Ayers in 20088...
two years in a Disney-concertal .
And he had happiness to an execution of the 1th and 4th symphony of the methovens --
and backstage and represented .
He spoke on a job and social existence of a jobiles .
Yeah and Ma and Hillary Clintongue .
Imagniters never said the Dodgers would never say the World Ssions .
All of attackle , one of the tricky celebratory
in the last part of the fourth symphony of the ethovens .
We talked about music . Later , I was given a mail from Stevehicle .
that Nathaniel to wrote a violate squieting me .
You have to know that Nathaniel doesn &apos;t want to be treatment .
When he was treated when he was treated shocket therapy .
chlorpromopazine and handbooishine ,
and that has signed him for his life .
And the result is that he &apos;s number ,
attacks of schizophrenia .
The worst of the worst attacks
plows up .
and he disappears .
He &apos;s going to be over the street ...
and the welling with that nargument and the worder in his heady ,
that following up at the time .
Nathaniel invented in such an agitated state ,
when we understanding our first lesson .
He had a male of gloed in such sense .
He was gone .
And he &apos;s talking to overcome
invisible demons and smoke ...
and somebody who wanted him in sleep him in sleep .
I was bang .
Nargument for self-meeting .
that I &apos;d gotta calculate .
that he would left out in the sweek ,
and that I would be relationship to the violent ,
when I started talking about toon-lash ,
and arpeggiownership , and other exciting examples .
of what you with viotional lessons .
So I started playing out .
And I played the first part of the vio-concert of the vioil .
As I playful .
I think of a clear changing .
in the eyes of Nathanielians .
It was like an invisible medicine his work .
A chemical reaction that my game
the catalyzes of catalyze .
The manic winding Nathaneeeliures
changed in understanding .
In silly curiosity and powerful .
If by package , he was such a squake , he &apos;s own source .
and started playing on it .
Now , a sense of viownerships ,
that I &apos;m going to recognize . Mendelss ,
Taikovsynsychovsynthesis .
We began to talk about music , from Bach...
to be ethoven and Brahms...
Brug , all the Buknership .
From Bartter to Esa-Peka Salonena Salonena .
I mean , I don &apos;t know .
a encyclopedical musical musical knowledge ,
but he was hit personally hit by the music .
And he talked about it with the meaning ,
And the deavor , when I &apos;m messaging and messages of my mind .
from the Los Angeles Philharmonicity .
By making music and make music ,
This guy changed .
of the paranoid , confusion
that right ?
from Los Angeles had been comentiny
in a charmante,
brilliant , classically writing musicus .
Music . Music changes changes .
For Nathaniel is a healthy .
And by music , he can be able to his mind
and department ,
through his fantasy and creativity
in reality .
Taike hirt .
They &apos;re troubledged attacks .
I think that the essential of art .
And that &apos;s why we do music .
And that we &apos;re going to take something that in us ,
deep in our nuclear .
Our extraordinary .
And that we &apos;re going to through our artistic lens...
through our crativity that allowed to reality .
The reality of that expressions --
Take our bottom .
We &apos;re going to inspired and engaged .
Nathanieelling
And they got a group of friends return back .
The reason of music brought it back .
in a family of musician ...
who he understanding him ,
those are talents of them --
and he respected him .
I &apos;ll always stay music with Nathaniel.
It &apos;s now in Walt Disney Concert Hall isen
or on the street . He reminds me of it .
why I &apos;ve been a musicus .
Dantelular .
Thank you .
Robert Gupta.
I want to play something that I &apos;ve got to play something that I &apos;ve got to put something that I &apos;ve got to do .
It &apos;s meaning .
I &apos;m Jane McGongal. I &apos;m a game designer .
All 10 years , I make online gametory .
And my goal for the next decade is to make it as easy to make it easy to save the world as it is in game .
Number , I have a plane for this , and that plan is to convince more human , to spend more time to spend more time at the play of bigger and better game .
At this time we play three of the week online game .
Some of you think , more likely to multiple of the time is a lot of time to play games .
Perhaps too much of time , there are so many important problems in the real world .
But in fact , I think , in my research at the Institute For the Toes , which is the opposite where issue .
Three of three a.m. ain , not enough for a week of world-lead problems .
Mealization , I believe that if we want the next century on this planet , that we have to increase that digits tremendous .
I have realized that we need for 21 a.m.
And that &apos;s a strange ideas , so I &apos;ll be able to say , I &apos;ll make it sense .
And if we want to be a wild of problems like hungry , climate change , global conflict , I believe we need to try to play weekly at least 21 a.m. empathroughout the end of the next decade of the next decade of the next decade of Neum.
This is the reasoning . This picture was quite good together why games are so important for the future of humanity . Eight .
This is a portrait by a photographer , Phil Toleddance .
And he wanted to catch the games of the games .
So , he put a camera for gamers of gamers ,
And this is a classic for classic empathy .
Number , if you don &apos;t gamer gammer games , you &apos;re a little bit of a games in this picture .
You see the sense of the feeling , a little bit of anxistence , but also intense considering a deep focus to a very difficult problem to solve a very difficult problem .
And if you gamer a gamer down here , you &apos;ll have a few nuances : the shells and mouth is a sign of optimisme-to-mouth .
The wentkrows are a sign of surprising .
This is a gamer that &apos;s about the state of something that was hot : a massive window ets .
Ah , you know . Okay .
So we have a couple of gamers here .
And it &apos;s an episode for an extremely positive , that you didn &apos;t know it was positive , that you didn &apos;t know that it was possible to you , it was a swells of the memory .
It was almost not to imagine .
And when you go down there , you &apos;re a surprised to find what you really art . That &apos;s a massive window .
This is a gamer at the point of view of view ,
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problems around the world , we &apos;re trying to see the next few choice is going to try to packaging .
The face of somebody , against all the expectations , at the point is to exist a sense of profit .
But unfortunately , we see this face in the daily life , we &apos;re trying to packaging problems .
This is what I think I &apos;m Ben National in the Levelular I called the Levelulation .
And this is me actually a towel . Can you can see the vision ? Ja. Good .
This is I &apos;m going to be Ben Naware of Good in the Levelusion .
This is a piece graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeling California , where I did my PhD about why we are better in games than in the real life .
And this is a problem that much gamers .
We don &apos;t feel good in the reality , as we are in games .
And I mean , I don &apos;t just mean successful , even though that makes part of it .
We have a lot more in game . But I mean , but I mean , I also intend to do something a little bit more inspired to do something that , inspired to work together .
And when we are in a game world , I believe that most of us the best version of ourselves words , the most likely to slums of ourselves , the most likely to multiply for length .
the most likely to be as long as it is requires as long as it is to a problem again , to a failure .
And if we were in the real life , a failure , when we &apos;re confront , when we &apos;re confront of a failure , we don &apos;t really feel like that .
We feel injury . We feel overwhelmed .
We &apos;re feeling our anxious , maybe depressed , or cynishes .
We never have those feelings when we share games .
they &apos;re not exist in game .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was to washing for a moment .
What makes part of games is it impossible we feel like we don &apos;t feel anything ?
How can we take those feelings of games , and they &apos;re in the real world to work ?
So , I looked games like Word of War-Warded Word of War-wasn , which is the ideal cooperative environment to solve problems .
And I began to represent noticing that allowed to make sense in the online worldwide .
The first thing I noticed is that every time you in one of those online games , particularly World of Warld of a lot of diversity , there &apos;s a lot of diversity that you like to have a global reason for me , measure .
But not just a mission , a mission that mission is a mission that &apos;s appropriate perfectly for your living in games . Jouist?
Dush , you can do it .
They never give you a challenge that you don &apos;t address .
But it &apos;s on the extension of your potential . So , you &apos;ve got to try and lots of a lot of time .
But there &apos;s no employment in World of Warld of wildlife .
You can &apos;t sit in a kidness .
There &apos;s always something specific and important that is done and important that has to be done .
And there are also a lot of contributes .
Every place where you galay , there are hundreds of thousands of people who are willing to help you to help your epic mission .
And that &apos;s something that we &apos;re in the real life difficult , that sense that there is a lot of collaborators .
And also that there &apos;s an epic story , this involving story that tells us why we are here and what we do .
And then all the positive feedback that we get genuine .
You &apos;ve already heard of a living riches and plus-force an intelligence .
Supping constant back-stream , we get into the real life .
And when I &apos;m here of this stage , I will not get any messages of plus a speaking , plus-up ideas .
I don &apos;t get feedback in the real life .
Number the problem with collaborative online worlds like Warld of Warld Warld of Warld Warld Warld of a support of the empowering profit , that we decided to spent our time to spent our time on games to spent our time .
It &apos;s just better than reality .
So far now , World of Warld Warld war , all of 5.93 million years to spend the virtual problems of Azeroth to solve the virtual problems of Azeroth .
Number that &apos;s not a bad thing .
It sounds perhaps a little bit .
To clear that a minute : 5.93 million years ago , our employed ,
And that was the first primary , justify primary .
And so , as we are as we investing about the amount of time that we investing in the game of the game of the measure-engaging about it , is to even knowledge of time in the context of the context of time in the contextext , which is an extraordinary thing .
But it &apos;s also display . It turns out to be a lot of time to play with so much time to play with the game of measuring , we &apos;re going to change as people .
We evolve to a kind of more cooperative and education .
This is what I believe .
Duses think about this interesting .
It was published by a researcher of the Carnegie Mellon University .
And the average young of medium , in a country with a major game cultural afford , for a long time , for the time he &apos;s been through 21 years old .
Numbers is a very interesting digit for two reasons .
Ten hearing , for children in the United States is 080 hours , the exact amount of time that you spent at school from the fifth reading the age of fifth teaching year to your graduate when you go down .
So we have a wine wildly opening of education where young young learning about the games like they do a lot of the games in schools .
Some of you have a meaning of Malcom Gladell-empathy of Outligent .
So you &apos;ve heard of his successful theory , the existence of the successful theory .
It &apos;s on this wonderful dignity , cognitive scientific research that says that as we can control for a long study to be able to control for a second , we can control virtual for that we have 21 , we &apos;ll be virtual virtual in words .
We will be a good at what we do as the best we do as the best of the world .
And what we &apos;re seeing now is a whole generation of young people who are virtuoes in the game .
Dush , the big question , of Where are becomes so good for massive reality .
And as we can behind that , we would be virtual unprecedented to human potential .
This is the number of people who are now in the world at least hours a day games .
These are our virtuoes .
500 million people who are good at extraordinary good at test .
And in the next decade , we &apos;ll have a messagers that have more extraordinarily good at something .
If you don &apos;t remember it , this competition .
And the gaming-industry is consoon developing that very little stream and needed with wireless telephone networldbing Internet so that gamers of business worldband Indian , mostly playful and Brazil .
They expect to be a meaning of gamers against the decades .
And that brings us to 1.5 m.
So I wondered , so I wonder this games of the games of virtuous ,
I have four of the meaning of the first fire optimism .
Okay , you can see as extreme self-motivation .
Brand-optimism is the wants to be a handle , to combined a heart , combined with believing that we have a reasonable opportunity on success .
Gamendly believe that a massive wild of wind , and that it &apos;s always worthy is to be able to do , and then now .
Gamers knights .
Gammers are virtual in the weight of a poet social standards .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that we have people rather after we have a play with them , even though they have a play with them , although they have the amazing thing .
The reason is that you need to have a trust to play with somebody .
We faith that they will continue with their time , that they will continue to play for the regules , that they &apos;ll be games to go to the game for issues .
So a play with somebody , the bottom the bottom band, the trust and the collaboratory .
And as a result , we actually build more social relationship .
Salive productivity .
Weith , there &apos;s a reason for the average of Warld of Warld of 22 hours a week , almost like a week time .
That &apos;s because we know that when we play a game , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we received or anywhere .
We know that as humans are made to deliver .
And gamers are willing to work hard , when they give the right work , if they give the right work .
And finally , epic meaning .
Gammers are low-framework on defense , stories of planetary scales .
Now , a small wett , a small wett to be a small weak .
You &apos;re all Wikipedia , the biggest wiki in the world .
The biggest weki in the world , with almost 80,000 articles , is the World of Warld of Warld ,
Five million people use it every months .
They have more info about World of Warld of Warld Warld Extrade , the other topic .
They build an epic story .
They build a epic source of knowledge about World of Warld ,
So , those are four superforces that are combined to one thing .
Gamers are super-for-engaged , hopeful ,
These are people who believe that they believe they &apos;re allowing the world .
And the only problem is they believe that they have to change virtual worlds and not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to figure out .
There &apos;s an economist , Edward Castrono .
His work brilliant . He seeks the reason why people spend so much time and spend so many time and money on online worldwide .
And he goes : Do we have taught from nothing less than a real mass exoso to virtual worlds and online gameworldview .
And he &apos;s a economisty , so he &apos;s rational rational .
And he gt... Nextinct , I &apos;m a game designer ; I &apos;m a game design .
But he says that this is a sense , because gamers can make more of a massive in a world than in the real life .
They can have more social relationships in games than in the real life .
They get better feedback and feel more likely in games than in games .
So he says it &apos;s perfectly logical that gamers spend more time in virtual worldings than in real world .
Number , I &apos;m going to agree that rational , at this moment .
But it &apos;s not an optimal situation .
We have to do the real world in a game more lifetime .
So I take my invent of something that 2,500 years ago .
This is an ancient dobusiness , made of sheep knowledge . Okay ?
For we had challenging controllers , we had sheep clean-buttttellers .
And this is the first piece of tools for that , designed by mental .
And if you &apos;re working the ancient Greek historian Herodotus knowledotus , maybe this story .
the inventors of the first game and why they invented it .
Herodly says that games played , particularly invented in the room Lydia during .
And apparently , the hungry , that the king of Lydia decided to downtown something .
People lights . People flights .
It was an extreme situation . They had to have an extreme for an extreme for an extreme for .
Duses Herodotuses , they found out business baggery and a massive policy .
One day , eat every one day .
The next day , plays everyone plays .
And they would be such a domestic in their playing , because they play are so book , and damn us under us in such as such as such as such as salient as the fact that they didn &apos;t eat .
The next day , they played games .
And the day after all , they were seeing .
And then , in Herodotus , they had this 18 years .
They survived a famine by eating one day , and the next day .
And I think this is exactly how we use games today .
We use games to emerge from the real world .
We use them to emerge from everything that was broken in the real world , everything that is not happen to the real world , everything that &apos;s not peaceful to the real life , and we need what we need from game .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end .
This is very exciting .
After 18 years became , Herodotus didn &apos;t make the hungry .
So the king that they would have a last door play that they would play a last dobusiness .
She &apos;s a very quickink in two .
They played one dobles , and the winners of that game was to be on an epic adventory .
They would be Lydia latency , and looking for a new hell .
And enough people living in order to survive of the life that are more wareness there , and hopefully they could make the civilization somewhere else .
Number this sounds , right ?
But recently , DNA evidence that the Etrusks , who would lead to the Roman empends , DNA as the ancient Lydiells .
And so , scientists have suggested that Herodotuses telling story .
And geologists invented from a climate change that almost 20 years , sustained the hungered the famine .
So , this crazy story could be true .
It could be that they saved their culture through playing games by playing games to a game for 18 years , and then inspired so much about it , and then inspired so much about the game , that they did their entire civilization in that way .
Okay , we can .
We &apos;re playing Warity since 1994.
And it was the first time strategy game from the World of Warld of Warld woman . That was 16 years old .
And they played with down-during 18 years of us play , we play for 16 year .
I say that we are ready for our own eventage .
Number , for half the population of the population looking for a new global .
So that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to take 21 a.m.
We &apos;ll leave half our agreement a day , to gamen an hour per day , until we &apos;re going to be in the real world .
And I know what you &apos;re asking for you to ask : How will we have that problems to be a great deal of Wel, which is where I &apos;ve been dedicated to the last couple of year-old , at the Institute For For the Tcome .
We have a banner in our building in Palo Alto, and it presses our standpoint of how to deal with the future .
You know , we don &apos;t want to go predict him .
We want to shape him .
We want to represent us to the best possible .
And then we want to give people the meaning to reality .
We want to imagine our presents , and then give people the resources to express their employment for excellent .
I &apos;ll show you short three games that I &apos;ve made a little bit of that I &apos;ve made a attempt to give people the resources to their own device for the future .
Okay , this is World Without .
We made this game in 20070s .
This is a online game for you to see a text of oil .
The text is fictional , but we &apos;re telling enough online to believe that it really , and to make you believe that it , and to make you real life as if you don &apos;t have any more . Dus, if you start the game started the game , registery , you &apos;re telling your heart , you &apos;re telling where you hot in your house .
And then we give you real-time currently , and data that show you what the exact price of oil , which is not available , how the affected affected , how transportation is influenced , or the schools of the schools of the schools of the schools of the schools of the schools , or there .
And you have to figure out how to live your real life as if this true . And then we ask you a blog about it . And then we ask a blog about it , to be a blog of video .
We started this game with 1,700 players in 20070s .
And we followed them for the three years .
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
Nobody wants to be changing their lifestyle , but because it &apos;s good for the world or because we would have to be told .
But if you didumpe them in an epic adventure , and they &apos;re telling :
This is a wonderful story and adventure to the adventure .
And that &apos;s what you &apos;d be seen to see how you would survival .
The deaths helped their habits that they taught in this games .
Dus, for the next global reasons , we decided to make higher bigger problems than an oil .
We made a play called Superstruct struck at the Institute For the Toes .
And the plot was that a supercomputer had almost people that had just been about 23 years on Earth .
And this supercomputer was the name of Global Extinction Awareness System .
We asked people to come online , almost like a Jerry Bruiner , Bruiner ,
You know what , Jerry Brust-cheimer , you shapes a thream team .
You &apos;ve got the astronauthon , the scientists , the ex-prison , and they have to rescue together the world .
But in our game , we &apos;ve been in five people on the dream , and everybody on the thream team , and it &apos;s your job to findings , and it &apos;s your job for the health , the employment of health , the amazing health , the amazing thing to do is to be a conceived of the newsplit .
We showed 8,000 people play the game during eight weeks .
And they spring 500 tremendous creative of sunks that you can see if you &apos;re on Google for the meaning of Superstructure .
And then finally , the last game , we bring it out on three magnitude . This game is made in collaboration with the World Bank Institute .
If you played the game out , you will be certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Institute as a Social Institute , classroom of 20s .
With college with universities all over Zwart African , and we invite them to teach social engineering .
We have a comic publishing . We have a system with levels in skills like local insizes , knowledge , sustainability , vision and invental .
And I &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game please with young , all over the world , especially in development areas that could be the advantage ; to make their own social entrepreneur to the world .
So I &apos;ll now go around .
I want to ask a question .
Now , what think of it &apos;s going to happen now ?
We have all these great gamers, we have these games that are the amazing thing that we could do , but no of them has the real world .
Well , I hope that you &apos;re going to be able to do with member , that gamers a sun source , which we can use to heal the real world , that games are a powerful platform for changing .
We have all this incredible superforms of this incredible superssive productivity , the opportunity to make a poet , this sense of burning optimism and the desire to a public significant .
And I really hope that we can come together to play games that a difference , for this planet , to be a difference on this planet .
And my hope is that you make with me games and play games like the guys .
And if I look forward to the next decades , I know two things that we can imagine , that we can imagine , and we can play every game that we can imagine , and we can play any game that we can play .
Dush , I hit , leaves the world changing play .
Thank you .
Since I &apos;ve been interested in the case of the real-effectory .
And that can be strange for a magicious unless you &apos;ve been coined for this to be a meaning of a meaningful effect , which is a suggesty of somebody believed that it really word-to-effect , the studio effect , the studied studio effect .
Just because the present of issue , that what &apos;s been thinking about him , a genetic resources or something else .
For the pinky , examples , as they dangy in faith , it gets a measurable bodies , it gets a measurable bodies effectable .
Something that needly becomes the perception .
To make sure that we understand each other , I want to start with you a very simple structure .
And I &apos;ll show you how it work-to-to-having trick for the years , since the age of the children .
I &apos;ve been tiny for him as a little boy to the scale in the 1960s .
I &apos;ll explain the trick , I &apos;m going to explain it .
And after that , I empty , why I explained him .
This is what happened .
It &apos;s further , you can visit ; my hand, you can visit .
I &apos;m going to hold it in this way , I &apos;m going to hold it in this way .
I &apos;ll my mind my little clip .
And to be there , in fact , there &apos;s nothing in my wild , I will be here in my wrist .
You see that there isn &apos;t a movement .
I &apos;m going to check here for a long time , nothing in my mind .
The goal is very simple .
I &apos;ll open my hand , and hope , if it &apos;s good ism , my magnetism will be humane .
The knife is devoted as celebrated , that I can &apos;t scutting it on the soil .
Nothing comes in or from my mind , not cheating . And you can observe anything .
Ta-damn !
This trick , I &apos;m often on young kids who are interested in the magician , because you can learn a lot about misunderstanding it .
Even the trick of the trick of the trick of each other .
Probably a lot of you know this truck .
This is what happened .
I love it . I love it .
I say I &apos;m telling my pols to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in and I &apos;m going to say that there &apos;s nothing .
That &apos;s supposed .
And the reason I hold my wrist , because of the illusion of illusion paint .
At the moment , my hand move away from your view , my wise fingering from his original place to a site of his original place .
Moomi tricks to be tricks who didn &apos;t have a youth , sitting in the business .
It &apos;s going to push .
And if I turn into my fingery .
And we can argue about it , why we don &apos;t notice that there &apos;s only three fingers of this , but three fingers visible .
That &apos;s because the brain information information in a way that it doesn &apos;t , two , three counter-telligent .
But it &apos;s not really going to go , right ? And then I do my hand ,
Of course , it doesn &apos;t depend on magnetism , but by the presence of the presence of my wisdom .
And if I close my hand , I cloth my hand ,
And when I turn into the weather , this movement for me , I can retreat my finger .
And I &apos;ll get away out of this hand . You reach it out .
A beautiful tricks for friends , and family family . Thanks .
Now , what does this have to do with the rest of the eabove ?
About a year ago I read a research that I read the eyes are completely opened .
I &apos;m not a scientists , so for me was this amazing thing .
And it turns out that if you &apos;re dealing a well-being of pilling around the pill of an amazing pill that &apos;s an amazing thing .
Moften , as the present of the ebo change , for instance , by a smaller pill , which you blue , and where you get a letter to be a letter , the bo measurer effectivity .
Even though , despite of both adaptations of medicine -- they &apos;re sugar pillensions .
But a white pill is not as good as a blueful .
Do I got really touched from the top .
But in the excelling , it can still be geckery .
It turns out that capsules are more effective than which species .
A little bit of a colorge capsulyellow capsule of one and red on the other officer is better than a white .
Dosering on this is a role .
A pill twice every day is not as good as three pillense -- I can &apos;t remember the statistics .
But the point --
Prole .
And the deaths a role .
And for the ultimate for the ultimate of the ultimate .
Ja, toch? A injection spoke a little injectle-center of a kind of injectory that you &apos;re in a sense of a meaning of mind that is injection .
This is an enormous image in its mindset .
It &apos;s lots of minds more than the white piles .
We &apos;re going to leave a graph violence , when we can show the extinct of diac .
The point is not as good as the blueful pill is not as good as the bluefully is not as good as the capability .
And not one of all the things has a real medicine .
You believe in your faith , it really makes it really in your body and it &apos;s a stronger effectory .
I wanted to see if I could look at that idea in a trick .
And I wanted to take something that &apos;s a trick , and really make it likely .
We know from that research that when you reality , you have to grabbs .
This is a needle of almost 18 inches . She &apos;s volved .
And I &apos;m going to get her a little bit of sterilize .
This is really my meat . This is not a particularly various .
This is my skin . This is not a Hollyword spectrum .
And I &apos;m going to spend my skin through my arm , and I go through my arm , until I go through it .
And if you look at overwhatever falling -- or if you easy falls , I did this trick yesterday and some people I don &apos;t know .
A woman was almost of her stick .
So , I &apos;m supposed to that if you remember the next 30--- you know , I do , you know watch the first heavy part .
You can look away , but you can look away .
This is what happened .
Earmed my poorest , I make a small glash .
Sorry, man. Are you this misconversation ?
And then just by my skin , and then through the other side of the other side .
Well , zero , we &apos;re in essentially situation as with the measures .
A species .
But you can now , my fingers , right ?
I &apos;ll show them . Here &apos;s one , two , three-, fifth .
Ja...
And I know people think if they &apos;re seeing this .
They don &apos;t know , he &apos;s a meaning enough for themselves , for a few minutes , for a few minutes of his publisher &apos;s exciting me .
What does that look like , extremely good .
Ja, I know what the people in the back in the back of the room , I don &apos;t think of the Okicks now I think of Mealvances are going to be closer to the screen sembling .
Let me show you this close to you .
And that &apos;s really my skin . That &apos;s not a Hollywood spectrum .
That &apos;s my meat . I can pull it out a little wire .
Sorry. If it you too much word-to-word-looking , and don &apos;t go to that dingle .
People in the room , or people in the room or seeing of the meaning of the massive , it looks like a beautiful spectrum , but if it really washing -- there &apos;s a gap there , and he would -- there . If it really would be a gentlement of the blood workers for the blood , I think of the blood workers for you .
Ja, there &apos;s what it is .
And I normally would be removed from the needle .
I would make my arm , and show you that there &apos;s no swonder .
But in this context , and with the idea of something that is that neighborhood and it really makes me the needle and I &apos;m so from the stage .
The next days , I &apos;ll be going to be several challenge .
So you look at that . Thank you very much .
I have a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve been having two .
The first thing seemed more to a passionate affairement .
It was a beautiful fishering , good structures , multi-self-self-a-a-self-a-a-realized .
What a fish .
In fact , it was a fairly growing fish to the assumption of sustainability .
So you felt good at the sales .
I had a relationship with this beauty for maand-a-for maand-a-during mass .
And one day , the head of business and asked me if I wanted to speak to talk at a meaning of the issue .
Absolute , I said .
Here was a company that was tried to solve that something that was trying to figure out our bought .
How do we keep the hands ?
In the last 50 years , we have the sea for the sea meaning of pollection .
It &apos;s difficult to overdrive .
90 percent of the big visual that we have of holding , the tunately , the salmental , sword fishing , single fishing .
There &apos;s almost nothing more .
Dush , how good it or bad it also ga-fishery , fishery is part of our future .
although there &apos;s a lot of arguments .
Vishing pollutaneously , the amazing althanks , they are inefficiency ,
A big mindset .
It has a self-conversion of the extremely conversion .
And that means that there is fish wildlife in order to get a pounds .
Next very sustainable .
And it doesn &apos;t make very good .
So here was a company that was trying to downtown .
I wanted to support them .
The day for the empaign , I called the head PR of the company .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
Dongside , fitting the facts of the facts , you &apos;re looking at its order to get the willion-growth of sea .
And that &apos;s closer , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been so far out of the coastal , that it dissease of our fish , and not concentral .
And he added ,
That &apos;s conversier to 12.5 to 100th , sink , the most providing of the extremely massively in the sense of provide .
2.5 to 110th , wonderful .
Two and a half of a watch ? What &apos;s a wild of water .
Two protein , since said .
Gewelry said . And the phone telephone .
And that night , I fell in bed and , what is a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , I called for the majory , I called Don.
And I &apos;m like , I think of Don, which are sustainable protein
He said he wouldn &apos;t stop it . He was going around .
So I &apos;ve been on the line with some people in the business .
Nobody could answer me a clear me .
until I finally got the main biologist .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
Dong-well-empathy protein protein .
Good , he called the Good , he called the malgae of meals , and then he said chicken chicken .
And I &apos;m like , for Kipballtycle ,
He said , &quot; It &apos;s Jaware , considered , malcular , shaking , sleeval , swood-up and processing for the measurest of the swell-origin , muntil commutters .
And I &apos;m like , of Wevery percentage of your foot is chickness .
All of knowledge , two procental .
Nouth , that &apos;s about 30 cently procently ,
And I &apos;m like , I think of Don, which is sustainable to figure out of fishing
There was a long pauthem on the line , and he sea , and he &apos;s sea , you know , there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world .
My love for this fish was overall the time .
Nev, not because I &apos;m a self-in-fine prospital prospitor .
That &apos;s me .
I lost my love for this fish , I lost my love for this fish , I sweeken the fish to pink .
This is a fish , which is a very different love story .
It &apos;s the romistic species , the kind of where you get more of your fish , you know more from the fish targevis to the fish .
I was first in a restaurant in a restaurant in south Spants .
A friendly journalist spoke for a long time .
She has more infortune .
And he came to the table , a bright , almost slow-slowly .
The cook-up had to throw him .
Almost twice .
And so , it was pretty much more , he was pretty .
Who can do a fish so good , after he cooked out to throw ?
I don &apos;t know , but this guy .
Let &apos;s get it Miguel .
Actually , his name is Miumble .
And it doesn &apos;t cooking the fish , and he &apos;s not cooking .
Ten doesn &apos;t least the way as you and I understand .
He &apos;s a biologist in Veta La Palma.
That &apos;s a fishery in the southweet of Spangle .
At the date of the Gaudalquivir .
Until the &apos; 80s , the vulnery in the hands of tinians .
They &apos;re forced up at what they &apos;re actually drawing .
They did that by drawing the country .
They built a complex canalense , and they took the water of the country .
It didn &apos;t want them to buy economics ,
and ecological it was a disaster .
90 percent of the birds went on .
water , for these places , a lot of birds .
And so in 1982 , in 1982 a Spanish environmental ,
What did side ?
They turn the water stream .
She literally , it &apos;s a button .
And instead of having water out of it , they used the channels to latent water in .
She &apos;s the channels of water .
She &apos;s a 1,100 acres big fish big fish , major fish , heart , heart , paling -- and at the same time , Miuel and company have the ecological desert .
The grow is great .
I mean , you &apos;ve never intend something like this .
You know , the horizon the edge of the infinite , you see , all over the channels , and you see , rich mandments .
I was there with Miumble for so long ago ,
He &apos;s a wonderful vental venture Charles Darwin and one quarter of Crocodile Darwin .
Or ? Kealize his weather , I &apos;m heading and slowed and scientific , sink to mind , and Miguel , gives Miguel , gives a biologeself .
Here , he points to a rare Zwar-Schoul-Schoul-Schoul-Schoul-Schouth woman .
Now , he pointed on the mineral needs of the phytoplankage .
And this , here he sees a group of the Tanzanian girafts .
It turns out that Miguel most of his career spent in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
And I asked him how he was such a visual expert .
He &apos;s like , he &apos;s Viss ? I don &apos;t know anything .
I &apos;m a relative-expert.m.
And then he talked about rarely rarely and algae and algae and strange water plant .
Don &apos;t get me traffic , it was really fascinating , a kind of biological reality .
It was amazing , but I was in love .
And my head swimming in the cooking piece of hot that I had the evening for evening .
So I brought heads . I say , &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; How is it that your fish so good for swells .
He &apos;s remember .
And I know what I know , church , the phytoplanking , the relationship , it &apos;s amazing .
But what food is the fish ?
What is the realization of the realm of the well-empasize
And then he &apos;s going to tell me that it &apos;s such a rich system , that the fish eat what they would be in the wild .
And the plantain biomased , the phytoplanguage , which is what the animal is the fish of the table plankness .
And the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-incurrently .
There &apos;s no farmed .
East heard of a farm that animals don &apos;t do it ?
And I rescued about this terrain , with Miguel and asked me , I &apos;m sure : Take a site that &apos;s just a site that &apos;s kind of like such a sense of the measure that I &apos;ve ever been taught to be a messages of the measurer for success .
At that moment , it was like a movie director .
And we went around the corner and saw the most wonderful face , thousands and thousands and thousands of rock flamingames , literally , a pink for situation .
And that &apos;s successful , that &apos;s succeed .
Take a look at their glimpse , pink .
They &apos;re at the party of the party .
I was totally wardly hot .
And I &apos;m like , I think , they &apos;re not at the party of the party
Jaseful , for the present Jaware said .
We &apos;re touch 20 percent of our fish and fish education ,
Last year , this area , over 250 different kinds of birds , over 250 different kinds of tends .
It &apos;s now the biggest and one of the most important private airs are becoming air airs in a very extremely afford ,
And I &apos;m like , I think , is a bird population that does not do good for a whatever you want to see on a fishery of sales of extraordinary extraordinariety of extraordinariety , it &apos;s a bird population that &apos;s good at the last .
He showed his head , needge .
And he said , &quot; Devoting extensive , not intensive .
This is an ecological network .
The flamingames of food .
The shrimp food .
So , how sleeval , the better , the more systems of the systems
OK, let &apos;s just take a minute .
A matter of the animals are not fertastic , and a vulnery that are measuring its success .
A fishery , but also a fish species .
O, and marries , who should not be a swell-wouldn &apos;t have to be here .
They breed in a village 250 miles away , where the bottom conditions are better to build nests .
Every morning flying , 250 miles to the vulnerable .
And every evening , they fly 250 miles .
They do that because they can do that because they can be the subsibility of the realization .
No graphy .
And I asked a penguin , so I looked at Miguel .
And I &apos;m like , I &apos;m saying Migelling 250 kilometers back to the vulnery and then 250 miles ?
Does it to the young for the young of reality .
And he looked at me at a Whitney Houstent-song quote .
He &apos;s sea : he &apos;s doing that for the present of the hair .
I &apos;ve not remember the skin of my loved fish , which is great washing , and I don &apos;t like fishing .
I don &apos;t like that . I don &apos;t like crawl .
It &apos;s that wrange , teacher .
I &apos;m rarely rarely .
But when I provided him in that restaurant in south Spanital , he doesn &apos;t make sense of visual skin .
And he made sweet and clean , and clean , you know , he &apos;s a poorer out of the ocean .
I said to Miguel and he kness .
And he &apos;s saying , he works like a sponser .
It &apos;s the last defense before something the body in the body ga-inside .
He &apos;s evolved to southern institute purposes
And then he added , but our water has no since our water .
K. A question of these fish are not fish .
It &apos;s a very success of the success of its since its success .
And then I realized that when he saw a vulnerous pitorities , he &apos;s a big understatement , because the water that through the growth flowing out of the Guadalquiver .
And that &apos;s a river that &apos;s a river that &apos;s river with rivers , chemical engineering , chemical disticipating , pesticide religion .
And it &apos;s because of the system , basic it &apos;s glash the water than when it came in .
And the system is so that it &apos;s the water .
So not just a vulnership , not just a vulnership that are measured to the health of his south , but a matter , a material , but a matter that literally , the literally far installing .
And not just for that fish , but also for you and miles .
that if the water flows away , it &apos;s in the Atlantic .
A drop in the ocean , I know what , but I &apos;m going to take , and I know what , you should do , because this love high-display , although rumber is also employed .
And you can say it &apos;s a recipe for the meaning of good , whether we &apos;re wearing about bag .
What we need now is a new farm conceptable conceptance , one of the extremely property .
But for a lot of people is that a little bit of too radicaal .
We &apos;re not realistic , we &apos;re nice proversity .
We are love .
We like the farket .
We love little family business .
We &apos;re just talking about locally .
We eat organ .
And if you suggesting that these are the things that are the dealse of good empathy , there &apos;s always a single church , I love rock of rock , but how do you know , I &apos;m sure of rock , but how are you going to feed the world ?
How are you going to be the world of feeal-to-having the world .
Can I honest ?
I don &apos;t love that problem .
not because we &apos;re not because we &apos;re now produce more than enough calories to feed the world .
And one of them leads today hungry .
And one of them , and that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the great inequality in department , not the amount .
I don &apos;t like this question because she &apos;s the logic of the logic of the logic of the last 50 .
Again , grain grain , pesticides of monocultural , chemicals to mountains , chemicals to fish , and the entire agricultural to be more people , and the whole agricultural of the sum of the people , how much can be the extremely impression of the wall
That &apos;s the motivation .
It &apos;s the justify .
It &apos;s been the entrepreneurial plan .
We ought to empowered it , an enterprise in liquidation , an entrepreneuring that production right now , which production is right .
That &apos;s not a support , and it &apos;s not an agricultural agriculum .
Our daily bread is now threatency , not by detectory , but by frumbling source , not by the last combinding , but by fertilyfish land-a-sea , but by clean water , not by clean water , but by clean .
Do you want the world to nurture ?
Let &apos;s start with the question : How do we go to feed ourselves ?
Now , how can we conditions of conditions that are the extremely for themselves ?
To dowish that , don &apos;t look at the agricules of the future .
It &apos;s old and it &apos;s old and it &apos;s accelerating .
It &apos;s strong chemicals and machines and machine , and it never really has something really good to eat .
So , instead of looking at the ecological model .
That &apos;s the model that is the relies of two extraordinary jobs .
Look at Miguel, like Miguel, like Miguel, who don &apos;t know their own worldding , who repain , instead of exhaustice that repaint-growing extensive , that extensive , in relatively , in relationships , but in relationship , experts in relatively because they are the experts in relationship .
And if I really , very honest , they &apos;re a better cock than I will ever be .
And I think it &apos;s primary , because if that &apos;s a great deal of issue , it gets such a way .
Thank you .
I grew up , on a constantly diet of a fiction .
As educational education , I went with the bus to school , I went back to school with the bus , every day .
And I was always absorbed by a book , a very fiction book , which I was in thoughts of other worldly invitable news , my involable news condition .
En, knows , who &apos;s curiosity , who has been in the fact that I was in school when I don &apos;t washing in school , I wasn &apos;t in school , I &apos;m in the forest , and mouth of the malental , snails , insnails and hospitch-water , insnake .
You know , I was a real scientific science .
But it was all about understanding the world , the limits of the potential understanding .
And mine love to be given to be mirror in the world , also seemed to be multiple , because what was happening , this was the account of the satisfully , we went to the magnificent ocean , Jacques Cousteau came to the exploring , Jacques Cousteain our habs of exploration , which are amazing , which we can never see our animals , and a wonderful world that we had never been able .
This seemed to resonate with the entire equipment .
And I was an artists .
I could draw . I could draw .
And because there were no games of games , and these collection of CG and all this is the meaning of alandscape , I think this is the main realization .
You know what , we had to do , as kids , as a kids reading a meals and description of the author something on the filmed in our heads .
And my reaction to this : painting , painting , drawing out of the world &apos;s critical , extraterous , robotic creatures , all that kind of dinner .
I was a constantly traps of mathematics sitting behind mathematics .
And that was the creativity that was an extraordinary for the meaning of it .
And then something interesting happened , the Jacques Cousteau program , made me very excited about the fact that there was a very excited about the fact that there &apos;s an alien world washing here on the planet .
I wouldn &apos;t really go to an alien world on a day in a spacecraft .
And that seemed to be disorder .
But that was a world where I had a meaning of a world where I could just go out here on Earth , which is so rich and exotic washing , if everything that I had imagined me through the reading of that bookfelt .
So , I decided to become more disappearance .
And the only problem with that , that I was in a small village in Canada living in Canada lifetime of the nearest ocean .
But I &apos;m not scaling there .
And I &apos;m sure at mind at the mid-school , until he finally found a disease school in Buffalo, New York , just about the border we lived .
And I took a message of a certification in a swimming pool of a YMCA, in middle , New York .
And I think of the ocean , a real ocean , not until two years ago , when we moved to California .
Since service , in the slength , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours of water , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours of that was in submarine .
And I &apos;ve learned that that deep sea , and even the undeep ocean , and even the undeep ocean with wonderful life .
The imagination of nature is so limited to our constraints , compared to our limitation ,
Until this day , I &apos;ve been looking at a time for what I see is a little bit of time .
And messy of love for the ocean is still as strong as they &apos;re washing as strong as they ever washing .
But when I adult as an adult a career , this filmmaker .
And that seemed the best thing , to combine the crowd I had to combine stories with my drink to tellent stories .
And as a kid , I was always doing the drawing of comic books , etc .
Films make the way to make sense of realize and stories together . And that seemed .
And the exciting that I &apos;m cood-told cell , except for it .
And with &quot; The Abysses , I spent The Abysses , I brought in front of water and collaboratory with films .
Say the two passions of combining .
Something interesting about the meaning of the Abysses of the Abysses , which is to solve a specific problem in those films , the examples of a liquid water , that we &apos;re generated , and it &apos;s a generated water , CG, surrounded animation .
And this result in the first of all , software surfacing , CG , who ever had in a film .
And even though that the film never brought in the film , it was closely supported to be a business of a supply , I was gard-supply , I was the public , the world was the public , showed the public .
You know what , it &apos;s a methor Clark of legal , that every single separated technology is not too distinct of magic .
They saw something magical .
And I became very excited .
and I thought , is something that needs to be able to get into the filmmaticipate in the world
Bush , with a term of the meaning of my view , we went to see a lot .
World ILMs , we empowered the liquid metals in that movie . The success is going to get . The success of it would work .
And that &apos;s what we did . And we remember ,
And we had a result of the public .
All of the money , we &apos;re a little bit more money on that films .
Bush , to get a line between those two points of experiencing , totally this is a whole new global , a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity .
So I started a company with Stan Winstoning , my good friend Stan Winstonishing the makest make-up designer and creatures in that time and it was a genomainitial Domainitial Domainitial Domainitial Domain .
And the concept of the business was that we would be mailing for the analog processes and so on digital , and we were going to direct digital production .
And that we did , we actually , and the gave us a competition for a competition .
But we found ourselves , in the middle of the 1990s , in the creatures and character design , for which we had gone to originate the business .
So , I wrote this piece of genaminal Avatory , that means to be absolutely the boundaries of visual effects , from CG effects , realistic realistic , realistic human rights in CG . And the world would be the world in CG , and the bounders would all be in CG . And the world would be suffering back in CG . And the world would be dwood back .
And I was told by the people in messaged by the people in mind , that we wouldn &apos;t be able to downtown this .
So I put it in the refrigerator , and I made that other film about a big ship that sink .
And I sold it to the studio alsize : a Romeo and Juulitory for a chickness .
It &apos;s becomes an epic romism , passionate film .
And what I wanted to do was washing , I wanted to go to the real wasn of the Titanickly .
And that &apos;s why I make the movie .
And that &apos;s the truth . Echterly knew , studio knew that .
But I convinced hengine . I &apos;m going to make sense . We &apos;re going to go to the walk .
We will use it in opening the filming of the films .
It &apos;s going to be very important . It &apos;s going to be a great deal of the realm .
I convinced them an expedition to financierency .
Sounds sound . But this comes back at the theme of your imagination that a reality of the reality .
that &apos;s really a reality that we actually reality a reality of a Russian submarine supply later in Russian undersea , two and a halfway in the northern Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic of the real Titanic through a path , not a filmed , not a filmed , not a filmed , not HD, but at least .
And I was a realized for it .
And the most propell-empowering , we had to develop camera and lights all kinds of dinner .
But I fell on how much these diverse , these deep tells on spacecraft .
You know , it was very technical and the most enormous planning .
You get into this dark in the sweet , you go down in this dark environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t return yourself back .
And I thought , as I &apos;m going to wish for the meaning of a fiction .
This is very copyright .
And I had the taste of the deep ocean of the deep ocean ,
Nature , the curiosity , the science component , scientific component .
It was both . It was a curious adventure . It was an imagination . And it was an experience that was an experience that Hollywood .
And I know , I was able to realize a well-looking for me , and we were able to do a visual effectively , I couldn &apos;t remember what I &apos;m going to do is extremely extraordinary for me .
As we deal with some of our next expeditions that I was dealing with hymal resources and sometimes things that I had never been seen before , sometimes things that I had ever seen before , who had no one ever been described before by the science of the time we saw them , and they were described .
So I was followed by this and more deaths .
And so I made a very strange one more decisions .
After the success of Titancient , I said , I think , as I think , as I &apos;m going to be a while , and I &apos;m going to be a while at a time of garbywood .
And so we started planning these expeditions .
And we finally went to the Bismarket , and exploration it with robotic vehicle .
We went back to the Titanicken .
We took little boately tiny challenge that we had a deal with glass .
And the idea was to go in and get an inter-investigate , which never been done before .
No one had ever been in the wrap . They didn &apos;t have the resources to door , so we developed technology to do it .
Bush here , I &apos;m zero-sized in the Titanicle of the Titanic, and look outside out of the Titanices that seem like deseem to be played .
And I cut up a little robot vehicle through the meaning of the ship .
And when I say , I say that I collect him , but multimate , I felt like I felt physically , I was physically in the creation of the Titancient the Titanicancee of the Titanicanices .
And it was the most surrelated species of deja-vu-vu-experience that I ever hatching for the lights of the vehicle of the vehicle of the vehicle of the vehicle , because I had a long time I had taken on the set when we make the movie .
And the set was like an exactly replica on the blueprint of the ship .
So it was an absolutely remarkable experience .
And it was realizing that the telepresence of the telepression , that you can see , the actual injected attars that you can be injected in the vehicle of the vehicle , in this other well-empowered .
And it was really deeply deeply .
And maybe a little bit of a look at what could happen , which is decades decades , as a cyboard of cyboard for exploration or any other purpose , in many kinds of purpose , in many species of the supply I can imagine as a fiction .
Bush , these expeditions have done , and really , start to value what &apos;s there going down there , like the deep ocean , like the deep ocean resource that we &apos;re wonderful barret for the wonder .
They are just sitting here on Earth .
They live in a environment of chemosynthesea .
They don &apos;t live in a sunlight based as we do .
And so you see animals that live next to 500 degrees of Celcius head .
You could think they can be impossible .
And I was also re-interested again , I was very interested in space science , again , again , as a fiction of fiction influence as a child .
And I got involved in the space of sheep , very involved at NASA , for near the NASA &apos;s deavesthesis , I went to the pre-cutternal space cosma , I went to the pre-cular protocools and all that kind of dinner , to the international space station with our 3D case , to the international space station with our 3D camertestation .
And this was fascinating .
But what the final result of washing , which I think I think of the scientists with our munam to the depth .
And they &apos;re meaning for deaths , so they had to astropolitary scientific , people who were interested in those extreme environmental environmental , they &apos;re going down to the sources , and they take samples and take samples and taking transition .
Dush , there were we, documentary films of the documentary as well as the documentary as well as the documentary of the documentary .
And I had the circle of the deaths of the fiction , you know what , as a child and all of this .
And I learned this journey of discovery , I learned a high .
I learned a lot about scientific . But I learned a lot about leadership .
Now , you should think that a director should be a leader leader , a leader , captain , of the ship of ship and that kind of business .
I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership to me until I detected that expeditions .
I mean , I think of a meaning moment of the meaning of the meaning of this ?
Why am I doing a thick of the meaning of it .
We don &apos;t deserve money with this disappeared programming .
They &apos;re nauthority . There &apos;s no floor . It &apos;s not to extract .
People think that I &apos;ve been gone to be gone by Titanicky of Avatory , and I &apos;m going to turn on the beach .
I made all of these filmmassive , all of these documentary documentary .
No famous , no glory , no glory . Where are you doing it ?
You do it for the work for self-challenging , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that there , for the exciting of the exciting , and for those strange band that exist as a small group of people a team .
Now , for all of these things that we did with the employed 12 people for years .
Sometimes at the sea for 2-3 massive .
And by that band-, you realize that the most important thing is that you &apos;ve got respect for them and say for you , and you said for you have a task , you can &apos;t explain to somebody .
When you come back to you , and you know , we had to do this , and we had to do this , and the fiber , and the date , and this and the date , all the meaning of the most difficult of the works on sea , which is that you can &apos;t explain . It is that what poligives or people in the agent . It &apos;s that possibly police , and they know that they can never know it .
And that &apos;s a band-a-mand-a-respectlement .
So when I came back to measured message , which is what Avatory of Avatory , I was trying to do the same principle of involved , which is that you respecting your team , and that you &apos;re in rilling , their respect .
And that really changed the dynamic .
Dush , there I was a small teams of a small teams of the meaning of Avatory , for the meal , new technology that hasn &apos;t existed before .
Enorm exciting .
Enormous challenge .
And we have a family , for four and a half a year period of four and a half a year .
And it turns out how I make films .
Bush , people gave comment on how the aware of , say , the ocean organisms , the ocean , and they put on the planet Pandora .
For me , it was more a fundamental way of the deaths of process , that as a result of that .
Dush , what can we synthesizes ?
You know , what are the learned ?
Nold , I think number is a curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing that you &apos;re sitting .
Imagine a reality of the reality is a reality of a reality of the amazing thing .
And the respect of your team is more importantly than all the lecture in the world .
And there are young filmmakers who come to me and say , &quot; Take me , &quot; Take me exactly what advice is to downtown .
And I &apos;m saying , I don &apos;t think of the existence itself .
On the other people will do for your downtown , don &apos;t do the meal for self-in-in-in-in-themselves .
And take risk of risk .
NASA has this sad where they crazy crazy ,
But failure has to be an option in art and discovering because it &apos;s a sense of deep in the deep issue .
And not a major endeaths of major entrequires that requires without risk .
You &apos;ve got to be willing to be willing those risks .
And that &apos;s the thought I &apos;d like you want to latent behind that in whatever you towers , failure , but fear . Thank you .
And if I can tell you one big idea today , it &apos;s that it &apos;s very much more of the data that we use , larger than the sum of the delently .
And instead of thinking about it to think about information , I want to think about how we can use information to get and trends and trends that would keep the way to remains .
This is a typical death involved into age .
The tollect I &apos;m using this is an experimental experimental experimental experimental .
It &apos;s called Pivoted Pivoted , I can filter on one of the death , for example , instance .
I see immediately different pattern .
And that &apos;s because here in the middle people are the most actively sitting there .
We can remember outside and the data reorganizing the data that &apos;s death of them .
We see that heart disease and cancer the usual challenge , but not for every single one .
And if we &apos;re going to go and go on the age , for instance , for example , or young , we see that insane causing the largest cause of causing .
And if you go down there , in a dive that for male .
And you see what I mean , you see , in this way of looking at information of the information of the living information graphicle .
If we can do this with rough , why don &apos;t we do this with content ?
What we greeted here is the front page of every single number of Spports Ilustrated that ever made .
All of this is . It &apos;s all about this .
You can go to your room and try this after my talks .
With Pific , you can get on a decade .
You can get on a meaning for a year .
You can go to a song number song .
I &apos;m looking at this damn . I see the athletes that are different in this number , the sports .
I &apos;m fan from Lance of Mstrong-empathy , so I &apos;m going to address , and that gives me all the number Lance .
And if I just want to look at this point , I think , why don &apos;t you know , I think , &quot; Why not all the realm of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaningful .
I do a step back and go on that .
Now I see Greg Greg Lemond .
And you see that if you laughter in this way through information , teller and broad , and then you don &apos;t leave , you don &apos;t blow .
You do something else that a little different issue .
It &apos;s there , and we think that it changes how you can use information .
So I want to think of it a little bit , a little bit of geckery .
Here we &apos;ve taken every page of Wikipedia , and it &apos;s limited to a little covering .
The consummarization is a small sync and a icology to be an icoon .
I just show you the top 500 popular Wikipedia page .
But even in this limited , we can see a lot .
We get immediately an idea of the topics that are the popular on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to check and check government .
Now , I &apos;ve got government , I see the Wikipedia categories that categories there it down there , Time , Time Mengine People .
This is very important because this view in no one of the aparte Wikipedia pages of satch .
You can only get it by doing a step back , and you can see them all .
And if I look at one of these consummarizations , I can look deeper on the understanding Time Persis from the year by showing them all of them .
And a glasses of all these people learn to me that the majority of politics .
Some people come from the physical science .
And one more smaller number comes out of business .
is my business .
One is coming out of the music world-world .
And what &apos;s interesting isn &apos;t a TED Prize winner .
So , we can make a sense of all TED Prize .
So , we navigate for the first time by the web as if it really a web , not from page to page , not from page to page , but on a higher abstrict .
And I want to show you one other thing to show you is that maybe amazing .
I &apos;ll show you the website of the New empowered .
Pivot, this application -- I don &apos;t want to be a browser , it &apos;s not a browser , but you can see there &apos;s a web page of a soair -- we bring these sized technology to every web pages .
I &apos;m going to take a step back and return , right in a specific section .
And the reason this important is that I think , is that I &apos;m just looking at web pages to look at my whole browse history in the sense of the meaningful ,
And I can go down to what I &apos;ve been doing for the rest of what I &apos;ve been doing for the rest of the time .
Here &apos;s the status of the demo that I &apos;ve just figured out .
And I can play some of the things that I can play earlier today .
If I put a step back and go and look everything , I can look at my historic sales on the basis of my search .
And here I did some nepotist research , and I was looking for Labs , and here &apos;s a giving Labs Pivoted Labs .
From there , I can go deeper on the page , and it again .
It &apos;s one metaphor that &apos;s re-metaphor that makes it very larger than the sum of the parts of the data .
By in our global world , we see data as a liquid .
We &apos;re talking about the fluency of the realization .
We &apos;re talking about drowning .
If we could take that on his head on his head , and the Web on his head , so that rather than to go from one thing to the next ones to the next ones that we can reference from many things to many things to many things , and see the patterns that could see differently silent .
And if we &apos;re not going to sit down , we can &apos;t stuck more in data than we can actually do it information .
Instead of just working with information , we might know about it .
And if we &apos;re knowing , maybe even wisdom to find wisdom .
So , thank you very much .
Everybody speaks today about happiness .
And I have somebody shown the number of books that the youngest five years of extiny the title , and he has been given up in about 40s , and there were a lot more .
There &apos;s a lot of very interested in happiness , research .
There &apos;s a lot of happiness .
Everybody wants to make people happier .
But despite the mass of the mass of work , there are different cognitive values that make it impossible to think about justice .
And I &apos;ll get it today about that today about that cognitive values .
And this is true for ordinary people who nameans of their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for researchers , because it turns out that we &apos;re just as in the war as the other one .
The first fall-falling is the square to enable to get complexity .
It turns out that the word happiness is not a useful word is because we it on too many things .
And I think there &apos;s one of the meaning that we could considered it , but everything is considered to be something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we will have to reach the more complicated vision of what existence .
The deaths is the heat between experience and memory : that &apos;s the difference between the lifetime and be happy about your life and happy are about your life or happy with you .
And that &apos;s two totally different things that are being thrown in one hope in the concept for sound .
And the third values is the illusion of focus and the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a circumstances that impact has impact on our wellent without the importance .
I mean , this is really a cognitive values .
There is no exactly a way to get this .
And I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who was a very demand a question of welling a story .
And this was nice .
He said he had listening to a symphony , and that it was absolutely fantastic music , and at the end of the extremely extremely sure such a screen sound .
And then , really motivity , really motival engineering that this had distural experience .
But that &apos;s climbing .
It had the reminds remind the experience of the experience .
He had the experience .
He had 20 minutes great music .
And they were not worth anything because he was a remembering ; the memory was department , and the remember was already what he had to do .
And what this is what this brings us is that we could see ourselves and others as two of them ,
There &apos;s an experiencing , which is living in the presents and the presents , which is able to re-re-engineering , but it &apos;s the present .
And the doctor focused to our experience , if the doctor asking , you know what , if the doctor asks the pain when I touched you here to touch for the meaningful for me of the meaningful thing to the afford to be the deathroughout to our experiencing .
And then there &apos;s the remindset , and the remind I is the one that &apos;s biting the state and the story of our lives and that &apos;s the story of our lives , and that &apos;s the deaths the deaths of the air as he asks to the end of the wiling of the realization of the willing of the wildlife .
or a sense of the journey of the journey , or so you know ,
And that &apos;s two very different dinner , I experiencing and the height , I remembering and the heading between both of the cooking lucky .
It I remember is a telling .
And that really starts really fundamental response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
We &apos;re not just telling stories that we &apos;re up to telling stories .
Our memmemory is tells us that wants to say , which is what we can do of our experiences is a story .
And let me show with one example .
This is an old research .
And that &apos;s really a meaning for a painful education .
I &apos;m going to spend you the details. This is not painful right now , but it was painful when this research walked in the years of the &apos; 90s .
They had to rest every 60 seconds about their pain report .
And these are two extraordinarily two of them .
These are their addict .
And it &apos;s been asked by the way of who &apos;s having the amazealization
And that &apos;s a very easy problem .
It &apos;s obviously that &apos;s aware of having pain .
His colon-colonuror , longer , and for every minute pain that has had been a multimated for one minute , and messages .
But here &apos;s another question : How many pain thinking of this , how many pain of thinking that they &apos;ve been hadow ?
And what a surprise : The surprise is that the rest of the existence is a much worse for a bad remember than the well-employment of the war .
The stories of the colonoscopies of the colonies of the colonies is a very important part of the wave -- and no one of these stories is really extremely involution or cheat -- but one of them is just one of them .
And the worse is the story of the pain the end .
That &apos;s a quality .
How do we know that ? That &apos;s what these people asked their colonoscopy early , and a lot of teacher , and a lot of teacher at all alaxy .
and it was much worse for A than for B, in their memories .
Well , this is a right conflict between the experience and the reminder .
From the point of view of the experiencing I &apos;ve got the clear public .
Well , what you could do with the meaning of A, and we really have clinical produce the chief of things , and it &apos;s going to happen to the collaborator of the cologic of the business of having the business of the tube .
And that makes a sense that the amazing pain of lidtory , but not a lot less than before .
And if you have that a few minutes , you have the experiencing of the empathy , and you &apos;ve got it for the memory of the member I think of the memory of the memory of the aware of well-empowered now .
What &apos;s a story ?
And that &apos;s true for the stories that are supposed to the memory us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we collect .
And what a story of being tells are important moments and end .
Einds are the universe , very important and in this case , the end of the end of the main .
Well , the experiencing I live his life .
It &apos;s got moments of experiencing , one after the other .
And you know , what happens to these momentum ?
And the answer is really simple .
They &apos;re always loriently .
And I mean , the present moments of our lives -- I have the extremely messages -- it &apos;s about three minute , says about three minutes .
And that means , in a life , you have about 600 million .
In a month , there are about 60,000,0000,000,0000,000,0000,0000,000,000,000,000,0000,00000,000,000,000,00,000,00,00,00,00,000,000,0000,000,00,0,0
It doesn &apos;t make any traces .
At the remember is not spent attention by remember .
And you know , in some way or the impression that they should be going to be from the telling these experiencing moments our lives .
It &apos;s the end commodity that we use for employee .
And how you know that eventually relevant to relevant , but that the story is not that the remindset for us .
So we remember it and the experiencing I and that are really different except .
The biggest difference between both lies in the majority .
From the point of view of the experience , you have a vacation , and it &apos;s a very good thing as the first than two weeks as well as the vacation of one week .
It doesn &apos;t work for remember .
For the member , I have two weeks better than I have two weeks better than the vacation of one week because there are no new memories are added .
You don &apos;t have the story .
And in that way , in that way , is actually the challenge of a remembering I distinct from an experience .
Time has very few impact on this .
It &apos;s remembering more than remember and stories .
It &apos;s the except that decisions takes dealt , if you &apos;ve had a maar, say , two colonologies of surgeons and have had to decide what he &apos;s going on for two different choose , then he &apos;s got to the least remember , and that &apos;s the surgeon .
The experiencing I don &apos;t have voice in this kitchen .
We don &apos;t choose between experience .
We choose between memories of experiencing . And even if we don &apos;t think about the memory of our memories as normally as an experience .
We think about our memory as a member of our empathy .
And you can actually look at this as a dictatory , as a dictature of the memory , and you can remember it the experiences I think of what the experiences do I do not needed .
And that &apos;s pretty hard to think responsible .
I mean , how often use our member ingene ?
And that &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s been given for the dominance of remind .
And when I think about that I think about a vacation that we had a couple of years ago in Antarctica , which is clearly our best vacation ever washing , and I think of it to some pretty often on other vaccement .
And I have my memories of that vacation for three weeks for about 25 minutes , for the last four yarently 25 minutes .
Number , if I had opened the map of the 600 photographs of it , I would be an hour .
So , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s almost anti-and-a-half .
There &apos;s a discrepanish .
Nuth , maybe I &apos;m a little extremely extremely , in the limited hunger that I have to rememories , but even if you &apos;re a vitement is the hammazing : why are we comparts of rememories in equation with the importance that we &apos;re compared to experience the interest with the importance that we don &apos;t remembering in the interest with the importance that we &apos;ve got so much of experiencing accountable , but even if you &apos;re a little bit .
So I want you to think about a thought experimental experimentation .
Now , imagine you know that on the end of the vacation of the vacation is going to be destroyed to be destroyed , so you know , you know , you &apos;re going to rememory to remember .
Would you be cancement ? And if you choose another vacation would be choose to you .
and you have to think about how you conflict conflict .
And that &apos;s not as for granted because if you think of time in terms of time you get a single answer .
And if you think in terms of memories , you may have another answers .
Why we choose the vactions that we choose confront of our confront of choice .
Number two lets leading to two notes of happiness .
There are really two forms of happiness that we can applications , one .
So , you can suggest how happy is the experiencing ?
And then you &apos;d like to say , how happy are the moments in life of the experiencing ?
And they &apos;re all -- the happiness of moments is a pretty complicated processes .
What are the metables that can be community ?
Troughout , today , we &apos;re able to get a pretty good idea of the experiencing I through time .
If you ask the happiness of the member I is that a total other seed .
This is not about how happy somebody lived living .
It &apos;s about how happiness or a full of the meaning of her life .
Total different conceptable .
Everybody who these concepts in one hope will make a coot of the study of the happiness , and I think of a group of the lucky for a long time of the study of the happiness of the study of the happiness of the study of the happiness of the study of the happiness of the study of happiness ,
The distinction between the happiness of experiencing and the suffering of the reminder of the remember , and there are attempts to the two separate separate , the Gallup Organization is a global pollump of what they think about their lives and their experience .
And there &apos;s more efforts in that sense .
So the young years , we &apos;re beginning to produce the happiness of the two ikening .
And the most important lesson we &apos;ve gone , think , is that they &apos;re really different from each other .
And you can know how to somebody with his life is , and that &apos;s really very little about how happy he teaching his life , and converted .
Just to give you an idea of the correlation , the correlation is about 0,500 .
That means that if you should meet somebody , you would say his father to meet you know that his length , how much would you know about his length ?
You would know something about his length , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
And a lot of uncertainty , you &apos;d have a lot of uncertainty , you have a lot of uncertainty of uncertainty , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are about their experience .
So the correlation is weaky .
We know something about what the sign of the experience of the touch I &apos;m telligent .
We know that money , goals are very important .
And we know that happiness means that we &apos;re too teaching to people with us , through time to bring with people that we mogene .
There are other pleasure , but this is a weightforward .
So if you &apos;re lucky to maximize the two , it will turn out that you can maximize very different things .
And the conclusion of what I said here is that we would not be happiness as a substitute for well-being .
It &apos;s a very different conceptable conceptable .
And now , a very , very , very , why we can &apos;t think about happiness is that we can &apos;t think about the meaningful things that we don &apos;t think about life , and if we &apos;re effective .
So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people in California , you won &apos;t get the right answer .
If you ask that question , you think people have to be happier in California , if you &apos;re going to go into California .
And what happens when you think about life in California , you think about the contrast between California and other places and that contrast than the contrast of climate .
It turns out that the climate is not so important for the experiencing I , and not even the thinking I decided that I decided to make a happy thing .
But because it &apos;s the way I think the boss it can turn out that you -- that somehow move you -- that some of the people are moving to California .
And it &apos;s quite interesting to go to what &apos;s going to happen to people who moved to California hope to move in the hope happier .
Well , their experiencing themselves will not happier .
That knows .
But one thing happens . They think they &apos;ll be happier , because if they think about it will be reminded , because if they think about it was reminded how terrible it was in Ohio .
And they &apos;ll think that they &apos;re going to have the right decision .
It &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and I hope I &apos;ve given you a sense of how fashion .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for youth .
Very much .
When we were in a couple of weeks ago , you told me that there was a very interesting finding me that there was a very interesting finding Gallup .
Can you have this with us mind a few minutes about greeing ?
Daniel Kahneman: Sure I think the most interesting result in the Galling pollution is a number we didn &apos;t have absolutely expected .
It has to do with the happiness of experiencing .
And if we look at how feelings we look at how feelings that income .
It turns out that under the revenue border of 60,000 dollars a year for Americans , and then it &apos;s all over a whole big group of Americans , and what 60,000,0000,0000,000 dollars per year ...
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year than people are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting more unhappy , and they become more unhappy .
We see a full-flat lighting flat .
I mean , I got rarely self-flat lights .
It &apos;s obviously , what happens is that money you don &apos;t have a lack of money , but that &apos;s a lack of money , and we can measuring those miserable measuring late lack , very large precise .
For the other ikness , you remember a very different thing .
And the more money you &apos;re going to get the more following you .
That &apos;s not true for the present .
CA : But Danny, the entire American streads of life , and the pursuit of happiness .
And if people who come up with them severe than that I think of being touched to be a little bit of a meaning-empowered policy and sweet .
a chance of politicies that the country would take the general result in a such result , and it would take the public public public public public public public .
DKeeemeans , I think there &apos;s recognition of the role of happiness in public policy .
That recognition is going to be slow in the United Statently , but in the U.K. , that doesn &apos;t think of the U.K. is this to happen in other countries .
People are allowed to think about happiness when they think about public policy .
It &apos;s going to take a time and people will debate about whether they want to debate happiness or the evaluation of life , so we &apos;ll have to study some of the life , so we &apos;ll have to be that debate for a sense of suspension .
How we &apos;re lucky is very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the member , and you know , I think about remember .
This is going to influency the policies in the next year , I think .
And in the United States are done intensions of the population means .
And that &apos;s going to be about a year or 20 of the national statistics .
CA: Wel, the exciting thing that this subject is the most interesting policy policy problem for the next few years , or should be for the next few years .
Thank you so much for your invention of the havioral economics .
Thanks to Danny Kahneman.
I &apos;m going to talk about today about climate .
And maybe that &apos;s a little bit of surprised , because my wellular time is about variety and business , about the things that we need to invent and support the poorest two of the poorest of the poorest of the poorest .
But energy and climate are extremely important for this human , in fact , more importantly than simply for this planetary .
It &apos;s climate to the crops so that their crops will not grow growing .
There will be too many rain , or too , too ,
Things are going to change so that their vulnerable environmental , just don &apos;t cannot adopt .
And that leads to hungry . It leads to uncertainty . It leads to uncertainty .
So the climate change will be a disaster for them .
The price of energy is extremely important for hengage .
And in fact , if you could choose one thing to do is , to reduce the wild of poverty .
The energy price is silent to the dalene .
Every , very advanced civilization is based on the front of energy .
And the cross-revolution lead to the industrial revolution , and even in the twentieth century , and even in the twentiest century , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerator , airconditional conditional , we can make move modern dishes and so many things .
And so we have a wonderful situation with electricity in the world .
Now , we &apos;re making the cheaply -- and let &apos;s make it twice as cheap -- then there &apos;s a new limiting , and it has to do with CO2 .
CO2 eds up to the planetary of the planet , and the equation of CO2 is actually a very extremely .
And if you telling up the CO2 that gets out , which leads to a temperature , and that temperature leads to a number of very negative effects .
And the effects of the weather , the indirect effects of the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to this to the extraction of changes that ingene , and so you get ecosystems that collapse .
Number exact amount of how to make sure from a meaning of CO2 to what temperature is going to go , and where the positive back is going to be a return on , and where the positive back , is about it &apos;s only uncertainty .
And there &apos;s a meaning of how much the consequences will be nice , but they will be very serious .
I &apos;ve asked this often asked to TV scientists .
we really need to get out of nability ?
Can &apos;t we have half or a quarter ?
And the answer is date , until we &apos;re going to keep the temperature will keep temperature .
And so that &apos;s a big challenging .
And it &apos;s very different from , for example , a very high-truck firm trucks to try to get rid of a 3.6 , which is trying to get out of it .
This is something that is something that was going to zero .
Audience , we don &apos;t stand likely CO2 empathy , more than 26 extensix .
For every American , this is about 20 .
For people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one .
It &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planettes .
And we encourage , how to change things to zero .
It &apos;s constantly constantly up .
And it &apos;s just a little economic changes , so we need to have a definitely relate to a measures of zero-sum realization to the zeroo .
This equation has four facility .
A little bit of a multiply .
CO2 , you have something about the left officer , CO2 , which is based on the left , and that &apos;s based on the number of human , the average use of services per personal services per personal , the average of energy for every service , and the CO2 , and the CO2 ,
Bush , let &apos;s look at this piece for piece and see how we can get this to zero .
Probably one of these values in the neighborhood of zero come .
That &apos;s high school mathematics , but let &apos;s take a look at a look .
First of all , we have the population .
Number the world today has 6.8 eight in mental today .
And that &apos;s at the rise to about nine emergency .
Duses , if we do it really well with new various health care , health care , reproductive health productive health care , then we could reduce that metable , missions of the process of the process of the progress , but we see a rise of about 1.3.m.
The extraordinary is the services that we use .
And this remaining the meets that we &apos;re clothes , clothes , heat , heat .
This is very good dingene , and it away from poverty means to almost everybody on the planetary .
So , it &apos;s great as this number of farm .
In the rich global , maybe the summit of the world , we can sutences , and the existence of the minority , but it &apos;s going to be a number , on average , the relief will be more than double .
Here we have a very extremely service .
Have your lighting into your lighting your lighting your lights , the fact , these children go outside and reading their homework .
Bush , efficient , E, the energy for every services .
We &apos;ve eventually we have good news .
We have something that we don &apos;t rise .
And Via diverse invention and new relationship by other species of autools , other species of authority .
There are a lot of services where you can reduce the energy that &apos;s wildlife .
Some of the services of the service , even with 90 procently .
There are other services , as how we produce measures or how we produce with air airs , where the meaning is a lot of smaller .
And dusingle , if we &apos;re numbers , we can have a factor three to self-circular factor , a factor of the reduction .
But for these first three factors , we &apos;ve gone of 26 empathy , and that &apos;s just not pleasant .
So , let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this will be a defining -- and that &apos;s the CO2 empathy equivalent .
So the question , can you get that to zero ?
If you stop coal , needle .
If you &apos;re going to stop natural gas .
Again , any way , we have electricity producer today , except for the emerging sustainable energy and nuclear energy , produces CO2 .
And so what we need to do is a new system , is a new system is a new system .
So we &apos;ve invited wonderful wildlife .
Duses , if I used the term , I &apos;m not going to go to something that impossible .
The device processor is a miracle .
The Internet and his services are a wonderful .
Duses , the people have contributed here to the present of many wonder .
We don &apos;t have a deadlinear , when you have to deadlinear it .
Most of you just wait out , and sometimes it happens , sometimes .
This is a case where we actually have to full of the measures and have to get into a wunder a well-being .
Now , how can I actually recognize this ?
And it &apos;s a kind of natural illustrategy , a demonstration that people to the imagination ?
I was thinking about a year ago when I was mosquitoes and I found out in some way , I found that .
It actually made it involved in the idea that there are people who are lifting with mosquitos .
Bus, with energy , this was the only thing I could do .
I decided to flies far front of my contribution to the environment here .
So here we have some natural fireflight here .
And I told that they don &apos;t even more , more perhaps not even more , they may not leave this potential .
Dush , there are all kinds of gimmunders like dieval , but they don &apos;t really do something .
We &apos;ve invitable to invitable , in an incredible scale and of an incredible scale and of an incredible construction , although people in many directions , I see there are actually the employment of the war .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing is , geothermal energy , nuclear fuser , biofuels .
That may be able to carry something , and if they do better than I expect , is that the best , but my important point here is that we will have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t get to any of these five , and we can &apos;t get a left because they all have their own important , because they all have their own important .
Let &apos;s first looking at fossil fuels , or burning on the fossil fuels of the collutting of the earth gass .
And what you have to do is to be a disease of particular , but that &apos;s the none .
You &apos;ve got to take all the CO2 after the burn , under pressure , sleeping sleeping , liquid and hope that it makes it continued there .
Now there are some of the profits that level of 60 to 80 percent door , but it &apos;s going to be 00-percent door , but it &apos;s a very hard time and determine where we have to have all that CO2 is very difficult , but the most difficult this is the long-term problem .
Who &apos;s going to this for science ?
Who will be there for a garant for something that literally exist of the argumes is larger than any kind of garchase you can think in terms of nuclear or other dinner ?
This is a huge volume .
So that &apos;s going to be hard .
The next is nuclear energy .
And also , you know , three big problems .
The cost , with the regulately regulated landing , are high .
The issue of security , really , that &apos;s really surely that nothing can wrong , as well , even though you have this existence that the split can &apos;t be used for nuclear weapons .
And what do you do with the waste ?
And it &apos;s not so much , although it &apos;s not that much , there &apos;s a lot of issues .
And they have to feel a good about it .
So three very difficult problems that may be extremely , and that must be received .
The last three of the fifth , I &apos;ve been peddal .
These are what people often the renewable resources .
And that -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t require a fuel distance .
And one is that the density of the energy won through these technologies through these technologies are lower than that of an electricity scentral .
This is energieland-building , you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of miles , more than you need for a normalize energy .
And this is also this intermittering burnt .
The sun &apos;t seeing the whole dag, and not every day , and not every day , and white it &apos;s not white it .
And damn , if you &apos;re dependent from this fire , you also have to find a way to have energy to have a energy to be available .
Bush we have big cost challenges .
We have transportation challenge .
So , for example , that these energy source outside your country , you have not just the technology invited , but you &apos;ve got to do with the risk of the energy from the risk .
En, closed , it sautomobile problem .
And to make that visible , I &apos;ve looked at all the species of batteries that are made for authorious , for the battery , for business , for business , for business , and compared that the amount of electric power that the world , and what I found was that all the batteries that we make less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
So we have a big breakthrough here , something that is a factor here , a factor of the approach that we &apos;re greeted , right now .
It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
This is important when you try to get reliable to get higher than 20 to 30 percent of what you use .
If you have a battery for 0percent , you &apos;ve invited a wonderful battery .
Number how are we going to go through , what &apos;s the right approach ?
It &apos;s a Manhattan-to-meeting ? How can we know this is a wildlife ?
Nouth , we need a lot of companies that are going to work on it .
In every single of these five paint , at least hundred human beings .
And a lot of hends , you will find . That &apos;s cheap .
And I think that in the TED group , we have a lot of people who have this already pursuing this already .
Bill Gaware of various company called eSolar who has a big thermal solar technologies .
Fishing Khosla investing in dozens of companies are doing great things and interesting to support , and I try to support that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I supporting a company , perhaps a business , nuclear power .
There are a number of innovations in nuclear energy , moduce , and fluid .
And there &apos;s been no regulately not a very long time in this industry , so it &apos;s not so strange that there &apos;s good new for .
And the idea of Terrapower is date , instead of a tiny attached to use a small uranium , which is U-235 percent , which we &apos;re realizing the 999percent of U-2380-.
A little bit strange ideas .
And they &apos;ve ever been talking about thought , but they could never be good similarity for it .
But by the way of the supercomputers can now , and hunt !
With the right thing .
And because you use the 999percent , reducing the cost enormous .
You know , you even though it , and as a fuel , you can do all the survival of current reactors .
So , instead of caring , that new fuel , that &apos;s amazing !
And it &apos;s a regulately the reaction . It &apos;s a map for a map .
You see in this animation , often the present of an ande-golf golf .
For the fuel , this is really a really dealing for the fuel .
I &apos;ve got a picture of a place in Kentucycky.
This is nuclear waste , the 99 procental , where the 1percent of it has taken over .
So it &apos;s called uranium .
That &apos;s enough for the United States for hundreds of years .
And in a good meaning of seawater , you get to filtering , you get enough fuel for the entire planetary of the whole planetary .
Duser , there are a lot of challenges for future , but it &apos;s an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of them .
So , we &apos;re thinking about how do we measure ?
How to report our report ?
Let &apos;s first look where we need to come out , and then to the tusensory .
Before 2050s , talk a lot of people about 80-percent reduction .
And that it &apos;s really important to do that .
And that 20 percent is going to be through poor agricultural ,
Hopefully we have clean and cementation .
Bush , to pull that 80-percent developed language , including countries like China , their electricity produce .
And the other injuries : Passistant technology in all the developed language , and we &apos;re doing that elsewhere to introduce ?
That &apos;s super important .
That &apos;s a important measuring point for that report .
Duses , how to report it for 2020 ?
Nouth , it has to those two evolves .
We have to improvements the efficiency of that efficiency .
And the less we putting , the lower the CO2 word-wordwide , the lower the temperature .
But in some sense , the degree that we extent , by doing things that we don &apos;t exist , by doing things that we don &apos;t have the majority , or perhaps even a majority of involution .
And these breakthroughout the measure , and we can measure that measure in terms of businesses , regular excellent things that are changed .
Here &apos;s a large number of books about several beautiful books .
The reality of Al Gorewal , for Century , and the David McKay &apos;s book , for David Soretoo .
They &apos;re really going to take it right and imagine a framework that can be promising in large lines because we have to have a wide wireless .
There &apos;s a lot that we have to come together .
So this is a wishing .
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we inventing this technology .
If you gave me a swish for the next 50 , I could choose the president , I could choose a president , I could choose a message in the case of whether I could choose something that &apos;s been invented with half the cost , without CO2 , this is the wish I would choose anybody .
This is the one with the biggest impactable .
And if we don &apos;t get this wish , the separation between the people who think about short term and long-term , between the United States and China , between the United States and Chinain between the United States and Chinatian &apos;s lives much worthy .
Dush , what do we have to do ?
So what I ask you to do ?
We need to do more finance of research .
As countries , when countries , they don &apos;t just have to be able to just about the CO2 .
They need to be able to speak this inside , and you &apos;ll be suspending of the ridiculous spending of the low-in-in-engineering .
We &apos;ve been invitable , CO2 taxpaylog , putting and managed something that the cost visible .
We need to wear the message .
This dialogue has to rational rational and understanding of the steps that the government .
This is a major true , but I think we can know it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
And I understand more about Terrapology , I understand more about Terrapo -- I mean , the first picture , can you give an idea of the investment ?
Bill Gates: Om only to downervous , the supercomputer , the supercomputer , all the big scientists , which we greeded up that &apos;s equal , that &apos;s a deaths of millions , and even though we have a time for the measures , and we &apos;re going to be the high in the hundreds of millions of millions .
The tricky is the building of the experimental reacts , finding the regulatory of the regulatory , the site of the regulatory to actually construction .
Take you have the first built , as this works like , as it &apos;s very clear , it &apos;s just overclear , because the economy , the energy , the energy , the energy density , as different nuclear energy as we have that knowledge .
CA: And jail to understanding it good , it &apos;s going to build deep under the ground like a vertical column of nuclear fuels of nuclear fuel enormous anium , and then the process of the process of the bottom , and then the process of the bottom , and then it &apos;s the process of the bottom , and then it &apos;s going to be thinking about the top of the bottom , and then it &apos;s going to be able to understand it .
BG: That &apos;s right . Today , the reactor has to be converted , so you have a lot of people and a lot of the controls that can wrong in the control that you have to open up and things like .
That &apos;s not good .
Duses , if you have a very good for fuel for that you can have 60 years -- I think about it as a background process -- and it &apos;s not a burden of that complexity .
And it &apos;s just a fire , and it &apos;s a challenge , and then the thoughts of them .
CA: It &apos;s a nuclear several problem , which is its own waste problem .
BG: Jav. Nouth , what happens to the waste , you can sit down -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this approach -- or you can actually realize it in a different and put it in another and fire .
And we &apos;re beginning to make the waste today , which is sitting in the reactor , or is stored in the reactor .
That &apos;s our fuel to initial with that .
Dush , what was a problem from this reactors is actually what &apos;s going to be introduced in the unsevenue , and you reduce the volume of the defall dramatically dramatic by processes .
CA: But in your global conversations about these possibility , where is the extremely thing to downtown to this ?
BG: Nouth , we don &apos;t have been excostly excostly about everything else , and there are equipment rules about everything that nuclear hometric , so we enjoy interested in Russians in Russians , Indiavy , Indiac , Indiac .
I &apos;ve met the state secretaris of energy about this , to be a retaris about how this is the energy agendly energal .
So I &apos;m optimize . You know that the empathy and the Japanese , the Japanese ,
This is a variant on something that &apos;s done .
It &apos;s a major step forward , but it &apos;s as a process of reactor , and many countries have been doing , so everyone who &apos;s been doing a potential candidate to build the first .
CA: Dus, in your minds , in your minds , and probability of something like this on the reality ?
BG: Nouth , we have these electricity for these electricity things that we need to think very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to think about 20 years to think , and then 20 years to immense .
And that &apos;s sort of a term that the environmental models that we have to enough .
En, knows , Terrapology , as well , what a lot of people &apos;s going to do that easy .
And there are now lucky business , we &apos;ve invited hundreds of indisease , indian , indian equipment , as the financision for their prosthetic installations , that they can competition with this .
And it &apos;s the best thing to do is , because you can use a mix of this dinner .
We need at least one to bet .
CA: In terms of possible changes in big scal, this is the biggest that you know ?
BG: A energy breakthrough is the very important voice .
That would be it &apos;s not even the environmental constraints , but the environmental constraints it right so much large .
In the nuclear sector are also other innovators .
You know , I think of their work is not as good as desea , but the modular human , which is another approach .
There &apos;s a type of liquid reacts that a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
So there are different de, but the beauty of this is a uranium mmolecule has a million times as much energy as a bves-molecular moleculation , and if you can deal with the negative effects in terms of the negative effects , the footprint and the cost , in terms of effect on the country and the cost of effect on the country and different gene , in terms of effect on the country and different dinner .
CA: If this doesn &apos;t work , what ?
Do we &apos;re starting with the regular emergency regular to try to the temperature of the Earth ?
BG: If you &apos;re in the situation , the as if you competition , and at the point is to get a heart .
What are you going to do ? You can get a heart operation or something like that .
There &apos;s a line of research that &apos;s extremely extraction , that are different techniques that would slow down the confusion to be given for 20 or 30 years to be given a sense of dealing for the meaning of the meaning of the measurements .
And that &apos;s just a kind of distance .
You don &apos;t need that .
Something that &apos;s because you don &apos;t even have to work on as a well-being , because you know , you &apos;re going to keep on food because you know there &apos;s a heart operation to be a heart operation to save your reasons .
I don &apos;t know if that distance , the importance of the importance of problem , but there &apos;s now the except for the invational , that has to be a very slowly , or if the invational process of the realization is going to slowly than we expect .
CA: Chilma cat cticipe , if you could , two sentences to them , how would you convincing them that they error from sitting them wrong sitting they wrong in situation ?
BG: Nou, unfortunately the skeptics .
There are very little with scientific argumental argumental argumental argument .
Does they have to make negative feedback effects that have to do with the clouds that compensent things ?
There are very little things that they can still be able to do it in a million that they can still have an opportunity of one million that performance .
And the main problem we have is just like an AIDS .
You make the mistake , and you pay a lot more later .
And then , when you drinking all sorts of problems , the idea now is taking pain to get the advantage to get the benefit -- and a scark pain .
In fact , the IPCC report , not necessarily the worst scenario, and there are people in the rich world that are going from the IPCC and saggene , that falls all over the world .
It would have to be that uncertainty that &apos;s going to leave us for this .
But my dream is date , if you can calculate the economic , and then it can &apos;t do follow the CO2 , the skeptics of the skeptics that there is no CO2 from the next , I would even wish there &apos;s CO2 out of the next , but I &apos;ll wish it &apos;s just because it &apos;s cheaper to be , but I &apos;m acceptance , because the cheaper than it .
CA: And that would be your reaction at the argument of Bjorn Lomborg, which is , if you spend all of this energy to the express of the CO2 , which is going to try to resolve the world and malaria , and so on .
It &apos;s a dumb waste of aid resources to spend money there , if there are better things that we can do with it .
BG: Nouth , the actual spending for that Re , the United States , say that the United States should be spent more than now -- is not so dramatic .
It doesn &apos;t have to be a weather than any gene .
It &apos;s really just in big amount of big amount of opinion , and they can reasonable people from being different , when you try something that uneconomic , trying to financierent .
That issue , most of them , maintaining a waste .
And unless you &apos;re very close to you &apos;re very close to you , and you only the teachers , and it becomes very cheap .
And I think we need to try to get more things that potential to take a lot less expensive .
And if it &apos;s going to be able to start , let the energy support you can get the energy super expensive , then the riches can afford .
And I mean , we &apos;re all over five times as much for our energy to pay without having to have changed our lifestyle .
The disaster is for that two ardless of the disaster .
And even Lomborg has changed .
His credo is credo , why isn &apos;t spot more about Re D .
He &apos;s going to be stepping , because of his empowered , associated with the skeptical rooms , but he realized that a fairly chample , and he &apos;s realized that a pretty campay-tools .
And so , there &apos;s a red wire that I think I &apos;m interested in .
And it &apos;s crazy how little the Re of D is to be funded .
CA: Well , Bill, I suspect I was from the name of the member , when I &apos;m saying , I really hope that your wish in fulfilling . Thank you very much .
BG: Thank you .
And it with you a little bit of a couple of mass when I wrote an article for the italian Wirescue .
I love the theaurus always hands in the hand when I &apos;m looking at the end , but I was finished with the potential , and I thought I &apos;d never been the word for the word of the realization .
I read you the text .
Now , invalization , nute , supplies are reupelooser , utte , failure , failure , reduction , spreading , spreadulter-cycle , spools , fully explain , public , disappeared , public , disabled , disability , dultiple , disabundant , decrease , decental , dulnute , dry .
Antonious : healthy , capable of healthy .
I read this to a friend , and I read for a friend , because it &apos;s so ridiculously washing for male , but flushing a male malar , and I stopped to themselves because of the choice and the choice that slap this words .
Good , this is a multiple of parthesis .
And I think this is an old pressure , this is an old printing .
But it was a pressure from the early &apos; 80s , when I started to begin to the lower school and a picture of myself except for member , and melately to the other children and the world to the world .
I don &apos;t have to say that when goddden no teacher .
With this makes the almost as if I was born in a world , I was born in a world of existence as anything positive to say about anything positions , I &apos;m being considered for the opportunity and evolved in my life .
So , I was going to go out and look for the 2009 , online edition , and waiting a front of refish .
This is the conversion of the text .
Unfortunately .
I think , especially , the last words of Dight-mental mental to be extract equivalent of the enormental ,
It &apos;s not just about the various .
It &apos;s about our opinion people as we flowed them with these vices .
The values behind the various and how we construct those values .
Our language influences , and how we see the world and how we look at other people .
A lot of old societies that the Greeks and the Romeines and believed that it &apos;s spread out of a lique that powerful washing , because if you say something hardly tells that it &apos;s going to be truths .
So , what we want to do we want to work for reality , is a really expressed , or a multiple of issue ?
If we &apos;re eating telligent to do something simple when the qualify of a personality , we limited them and work a shadow about their force .
Don &apos;t we far doors for them ?
Somebody who was opening for me up my doctor , when I was washing for A.I. Dupont Institute in Wilmon , Delawaree .
It &apos;s called Dr. Pizzutle-load .
Italian American , whose name was extremely hard to speaking , so he was to Dr. Please .
Dr. Ped always very color-to-to-standards the good institution to children .
I mean , I think , almost everything in the time that I &apos;m welling , with exception of the physiotherapy sessiotherapy .
I mean , almost countless telligent realizations with that dikingly disease -- different colors -- different colors -- to build my benefit .
I hatte that elastonished more than both .
I hatte them , gave them narrative . I hated them .
As a five-year-year-old child , I negotiate with Dr. Preference that exercise .
And one day he came in with a session -- and he came in with a session -- and he said to measure , and he said to measure : Taime , you &apos;re such a deathy of girl , I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to take a giracle of such as I &apos;m going to make sure .
And if you allow a meaning for me to cut hundred hundred dollar .
Of course , this was a tactical puts to do the practice I wanted to do the exercises that I didn &apos;t want to do with the richest five-year-year-old girl of girl of the decation , but what he actually did for me to me was a narret , daily evolved to a weather , various experience .
Now , I &apos;m asking , I &apos;m going to ask in a correct vision and powerful girl , my self-decade , my self-image , as an inherently , powerful and afforders of the future .
This is an example of how adults in power play powers , in power play separate a child .
But in the previous situations of that thesis , our language reality that we would like to reality to the reality that we all like to see , the opportunity for the individual to the individual .
Our language is following changes in society , and many of them are evolved by technologies .
With medical appropriate , my gentlement , my gentlements for worldwide , titanium defines and hip focused for old bodies to deal with their possibilities to deal with their opportunity to deal with their own , to be able to described , but to sure about social networldwide , which people can consider themselves , where people can describing themselves , so that they can describe to the global ,
So , perhaps technology is now a lot of clear something that &apos;s always a truth : that everybody has something extraordinary and something powerful has to offer , and that ability to fit our best property .
And the ability of human beings is interesting because everybody wants to continue to constantly with me to exploring for me , and I &apos;m going to have a little knowledge , and I &apos;m going to now .
And that sentence has never ever never empowered me , and it felt uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and I &apos;m going to start to get to get the questions .
And the frase of the extraordinary well-being of implies that success or happiness or happiness meaning a challenging experienced , no business of being publishing , as if my successfully , if my life are sequently consequental pollen , which others others have been able to embenefit with artificial .
But in reality , we &apos;ve been changed . Of course , we &apos;ve been text by a challenge , or both of them .
And my imagination is that a good thing .
Today is not obstacle that we need to go through and to life .
It &apos;s a part of our life .
I have the tendency it as my shadow .
Sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes I see a lot of it , but it &apos;s always measure .
I &apos;m not going to be the impact , and the importance of somebody &apos;s wildation .
There &apos;s a contradiction and challenge in the life , and it &apos;s all really all and for everyone else , but the question is not the question that you will have to represent , but how to replicate with it .
So , our responsibility is not simply to protect our next to , but they &apos;re good for it to be good at it .
We don &apos;t prove our kids feel they don &apos;t make sense that they &apos;re not able to fit .
There &apos;s a very important difference and distinction between the objective fact that I &apos;m an amputated and the subjective society .
Actually , the only actual disability that I &apos;ve been constantly constantly on the world that you could describe to me with that describe to me with that describe me with that definitely describe to me with that definitely described me with that definitely describing me is that you could describe to me with that definitely describe to me with that definitely describe me with that defining .
And in our desire to protect our to protect by giving them the pound of their feet , or even a prognosis of the car , or even a prognosis of the field of life , we need to be the most stone of the things that we really don &apos;t involve anyone that we really involve someone involves .
Maybe it makes the current way of looking at what &apos;s piece to you , and how we have to repair , somebody else in the pathology self-influence .
It &apos;s not to go out of the reality of a personally , by their strength , not to acknowledge , we have a new disease on the natural order of the natural worky that they may be .
And in fact , we added up to somebody &apos;s added for our society .
So , we need to look around the pathology around the pathology of the massive .
The most important thing is that there &apos;s a collaboration between those visible text order and our best creative capability .
It &apos;s not going to default those difficult times , or to make sense of what we want to avoid or under the floor , but instead instead of it in the counter-setttorities .
Maybe the idea that I want to shape that you don &apos;t have to store your bedrock , but you have to open for it , but you have to open up a strengaging , but you &apos;ve got to use a struggle .
If we look at that as a naturally , consistant and useful , we feel like it , we may feel less about it .
This year we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin , and when he wrote 150 years ago , I think of evolution , I think a fact that &apos;s environment .
It &apos;s pretty translated , it &apos;s not the strongest species that survival , the most intelligent , but the species that have changed the most exciting thing .
Conflict is the genesis of creational .
Even other from Darwinter , we can make up the human ability to survive and driven by the mental mental conflicts to transformation .
Again , transformation , transformation , which is our biggest capacity .
Until we know about provision , we don &apos;t know what we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re about .
And light is that the one that contradictionary : self-realizing , a sense of our own force .
So , we &apos;re going to be gift ourselves a gift .
We can reimagine , as a more difficult than just a middle .
Maybe we can see it as a change .
Today change is a change that we don &apos;t have an adapted yet .
And I think the most important contradiction that we &apos;ve given ourselves the understanding of the majority .
Who is there than normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s habrief . There is typing . There &apos;s no normal .
And it should be a regularly to meet as a major extinction ?
I thought it .
And if we can deal with the paradigm of pursue to one of the potential , or a potential , or the potential , we can institutory to be a lot more kids , and they invite their self-organization and invitable their rare , and invitable to defense with the paradigm of the paradigm ,
Anthropologists telling us that the only thing we need to have people of our groups of our groups are along to dragging .
And there are singing that Neanderthalers 60,000 years ago , their elders , and perhaps severe injuries , maybe because the life-experience and survive from these people to the order of value for the empathy , they don &apos;t seen telegated and utelevision .
A few years ago I was on the market in the village where I grew up in that red piece in nordoor Pennsylvaniade , and I stood above over the tomain .
It was a summer . I had a short broke .
I heard a guy behind me : Aimee , if Aimee Mullins arrived
I turned out , it was an old male . It was an old male . It &apos;s a very kind of a mallest .
I &apos;m like , Pardonation of Pardonation , I can &apos;t remember that grid .
He &apos;s a little bit of it is possible that you don &apos;t know anymore .
When we met , I had to meeting you out of your moving out of your mom ,
Okay .
And it was the quarter of the quarter .
This guy was a doctor Keaning , a guy I just filled by my mom , because I was going to be tellyggory for my own birthday .
And my modern doctor had been a vacation of a vacation , so the guy who was a strange for my age .
And because I was born without any caught feet , and a couple of tens to the other feeding , and the other footage of the bad news .
And he said to me , I mean , I think , you know , I think , you could never have any movement , and it would have no motivity to have other children and totally no independent life could have no independent lives at all the time of my mind .
And the extremely maintended that he has collected newspaper for my childhood , whether it was that I was a playwon in order , or it was that I &apos;m a game lass of regulated with the muscles of Heallowed , or one of my mind exchange ingenuingencingeny , and uses he used to remind , and he using the extinctigreentated the Hah , and the sprineately school and the Hah and the chlengy of hormentched school , and the Hy , and the Hy of the tey of the entchlentchy of his school and the Chanchlin , and ,
Of course , he called this the x-facility , the potential of the wildlife .
No prognosis can predict how powerful this can be as a beak factor for quality of somebody &apos;s life .
Doctor Kean went away , he sea : I &apos;m experiencing , if it &apos;s not going to be contracted , and even with excell-consequency , a child from itself will be an aware of chall.m.
See , doctor Kean had thought changed his thinking .
He understood that there is a difference between the empathy and what somebody could do with it .
And in the course of time , my thinking has changed , if you had asked me as a 15-year-old , or I would have my art legs for real benefit , I had no doubt .
I was supposed to such a normality .
If you ask me now than I know it now , I don &apos;t know ,
That &apos;s because of the experiences that I haven &apos;t despite the experiences that I haven &apos;t despite the experience .
Maybe this is changed in me because I &apos;m more exposed to people who have opened for me than those doors who wanted me to go to the ones and shadom .
Look , you have only one human being shows you to have the opening of your force , and there &apos;s going to be a meaning of your own force , and there &apos;s a massive experience .
And if you can somebody the key to his own massive , the mind is so received , if you can , and at a critical moment , if you can open a door in the best way .
You learn them to open up the doors .
The exactly meaning of the word for the word of amazing exactly for the realm of the realm of the realm of the exactly of the reality of the exactly memory of the word of the exactly meaning of the meaning of the realm of the word .
And that means that what &apos;s inside is going to form and bringing out , potential , potential to outside .
So again , what potentially potential , what potential we want to bring out ?
There was a case-study in the 1960s , in English , where they from gymnasia to school-nation-to-in-theory study .
It &apos;s called the pression of trials . In the United States , we call the present of the massively for the meaning of the present .
And they resharing for 9, 98, and so on .
And the empathy of the present packager , the best teacher , etc .
And then , in three massive , they gave 4-meets for a sense , they were telling for 10 , they were telligent to wareness .
At the end of the three massively majority .
The hartap-heart heat-heart head of these study is that they were told for the meaning-employment of the challenge of cheat .
And that happened after three months .
Those of you who are in school wareness , the people who had gotta .
A critical part of this research was that the teachers were also wildlife .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that there was a sinterchange .
And there was a teenth of telligence , this is the present of a teenth .
And so they went to and so they were treated sea .
I think the only real hands of real disability , a collapsed spirit , no highly known .
It doesn &apos;t see a beauty .
He has no longer curiosity , child &apos;s curiosity , not yet us , and also not our attached ability .
And if we can , instead the spirit of the mind to be hope , to be beauty in itself and others , to sequently news , to use a sense and fantasy of the wildlife , we actually use our challenge .
And as a spirit of these qualities , we &apos;re able to be able to realize new reality .
I want to close with a poem century Perzero century Persian poem , Have , about which my friend Jacques me .
The god is called &quot; The god of four words knowledge
Every child knows Godd , not the God of beef , not the God of cloth , but the God who repeated to the extent that he repeat repeat repeated to the rehair challenge of the Kudance of miron .
Thank you .
