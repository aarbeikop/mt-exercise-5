A couple of years ago , Peter Skillman , at TED, a design competition .
The marshmallow-challenged .
The idea is pretty simple : Grepearing four of us to make a high work with twenties of spaghetti , a massion of tapology .
The marshmallow mallow there .
And it turns out , although it turns out , it turns out to be quite hard , because this assignment people to work together .
And because I decided this interesting idea , I decided to take it into a design workshopped .
And it was a big successful .
Since then , I &apos;ve done this exercise in about 70 design workshops around the world with exercise , designers , and even with Fortune of Fortune , and even with Fortune 50-business .
And this exercise gives us deep insights in how people collaboratory , and I want a few of that .
Normally , the first step that people are on the case that people on the case .
She &apos;s resources for how it &apos;s going to play , play with power games .
Then they go planners .
They sketches and monstruggling .
The biggest part of the time they built work on the spaghettes of spaghettes .
And at the end , when the time is almost about , somebody packages the marshmallow them to do a piece of the marshmallow , putting back on top of the Tadake .
They &apos;re wonder their tools .
But what &apos;s really happening , usually , is that the case of the massive employee , because the weight of the marshmallow for the entire construction and collapse .
although people have more of that extraordinary extraordinary measures more than other .
And what of the worst has been studied with a MBA.
They play , they &apos;re playing out , and they &apos;re going to make sure , and they make sure employee .
And besides there are a teams that a lot more excell-empathy .
And at the best of them have just been graduated column .
That &apos;s a impressive .
And Peter tells , they &apos;re not just making the highest building .
So , what you &apos;re going to ask , how to do you dive , what do that ?
Peters answer issues , it &apos;s a Gone of the children &apos;s boss to be the boss of Spagency BV.V.
They don &apos;t waste time with power games .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And that &apos;s it that economists have been training for the only right thing .
And then they go out that out .
But what &apos;s happening , when they were the marshmallow the marshmallow is that they don &apos;t greed time . And dance ?
It &apos;s a disaster .
Counds sound , certainty ?
And what &apos;s going to do .
is that they with the marshmallow .
They build prototypes, and new prototype pes...
and the marshmallow upper , so they have more opportunity to repair .
Designers recognization as the basis of an iterative processes .
At the metaneously , the kids get a feedback about what it is not going to work .
So the building prototypes is very important .
But let &apos;s see how different teams are the dead .
The average for the mediums is about 50 cmill .
economists there half ,
Twelry , better than the extraction .
Who does it spend ?
chitects and engineering , happily .
The highest construction that I &apos;ve seen was a high-empathy .
And what &apos;s the extremely retilate , and self-rement measuring geometric structures are the key to building stable to build stable towards stable .
CEO-average , something better than average .
But now it becomes interesting , if you get a secretary at the team , they &apos;re going to get a secretary .
Incredible . You can see the team and think-to-based wind .
That can you see from test view . And value ?
although they are good at support to support .
They &apos;re managency to understand the processes .
And every team that &apos;s fresh and attention for the work is going to work the performance of that team is going to good come .
And specialized and supportive skills lead to a successful .
If you normally get 10 teams to do this , there will be a magnituation of a state work .
And I tried to try something interesting .
I thought , we make it a little exciting .
So I was going to walk on the profounds of software from the winning teams .
And what do you think these designers are defining ?
What happened ?
The next ones .
No single team had built a state .
It &apos;s been an inches , which was an inch , an inches had been an inches to price .
interesting that a higher input that higher insistance .
We have the exercise repeately for the exercise .
And what do you think about that then ?
So they &apos;re now understanding prototypes .
And this team changed the worst team in one of the bad team in one of the bee .
They made the highest building in the least .
So that &apos;s a good lesson for us about the nature of reward and successful .
You might ask yourself : Why would somebody want to spend some time to spend a marshmallow-challenge ?
And the reason , I work with creating digital tools and processes to help with building teams of autools , computer games and visual effectively .
And the marshmallow-challenge helps them up to the hidden assumption .
Want , honest , honest project has its own marshmallowed , nothing ?
The challenge is a regard of an experiencing an amazing branchallenge to makes the best prototal prototype .
And so that &apos;s the value of the experience of the exercise of the exercise .
And for massive interests , will go to marshmallowchallenge .
On this blog , you can see how to build the mashmallows .
There are stacking structions .
There are preview of how people all around the world have tricks and adaptation .
There are also a global records .
And the fundamental lesson , think , really design a contacts .
It &apos;s the protein of all of our senses , and that we use our best knowledge and exploring for the challenge that our lightforward for us .
And sometimes a small prototype prototype of this experience to make sense of the ade-mal-to-having a massive moment in a massive moment .
And that makes a big differently .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s just assume that we have a machine , a big machine , a big machine , a major machine for me , and it &apos;s still a time machine for a while , and it &apos;s still a time machine .
And everybody here has to involve .
You can remember in time or forward in the time , but not here and now .
I &apos;ve been gotten what you would choose , because I &apos;ve asked this question all kinds of friends , and they all want to go back .
They all want to go back to the time before authority of Twitter or Twitter or Twitter for the meaning of empowered .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s a certain hang of nostallel , to state .
And I can come in there .
But I don &apos;t hear there , I have to say that .
I don &apos;t want to return back , and not because I &apos;m so adventure -- but for the potential of these planetary .
And they &apos;re not going to go forward , who are going forward .
So I want to go in the case , and I want to move forward in the time .
We &apos;re living in the violent time on this planet on what area , but the wealth of wealth , wealth cansensory , cansending of disease .
Never was a time of desea .
And my grandparents are all the time of 60s .
My grandparents did all the 70s .
And my parents are already at the 800s .
So , I can get a piece in the 90 piece in the middle .
But it &apos;s not just about ourselves .
There &apos;s a lot more on the game .
A kid in New Delhi is born in New Delhi has a life-expectancy to that of the wealth man in the world .
Think about that . That &apos;s an incredible facts .
And why is it true ?
The smallpox . The smallpox are people on this planet of life .
They had an influence on the demography of this world bigger than any war .
But they don &apos;t existence . They &apos;re far .
We &apos;ve gone . Pof!
In the wealthy world disease , which is a generation of millions of people threat , as good as not millions of people , as well .
Diftery , rodehunched child ,
somebody here still know what that &apos;s that ?
Inentiny , modern medicine our possibilities to suppose argument , are all triumps of scientific method .
And for me , is the scientific method , trying to figure out whether it works and nonetheless , one of the biggest business of humanity .
That &apos;s the good news .
But the only good news is that the only good news because there &apos;s a number of other problems , it &apos;s a lot of other problems , and it &apos;s date for all of our resources , there &apos;s still a multiple of people in this world , every single day , there &apos;s still a dark of people in this world every day .
Their number of takes , and it takes sense .
And not just date , we also have our imagination to pollutting the world &apos;s resources .
Drinkable water , agriculture , rainforest , gas: they are disappearance , and if we &apos;re not able to be able to be able to innovation out of this mission , also will be the way to work , we &apos;re going to be gone .
The question is : Can we have this question .
And I think it &apos;s clear that we &apos;re able to be able to make sure for the realization of the regulately that we live out .
I think we can see these world of energy forms that are not in the realm of energies .
I believe that morning , etc . I don &apos;t think , that &apos;s not a wall .
But now , I think that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to wake up at night -- one of the things that I woke up at night .
Never we have been so dependent on scientific progression , necessarily , and never we &apos;re able to make sure that we have been able to make of use today .
We &apos;re on the threshot of the most amazing advantage of the most amazing thing .
And I really think we &apos;re going to say hundreds of years , say , 300 years , you have to go back to the time of the Ulightning , to find a time of the United States , to find this innovations that we &apos;re hearlier , and fought in more areas and fought in areas .
People hunting their faith spot with such a dealing of heart that it &apos;s impossible for it .
And listening , everybody has right on his own mental ; everyone has even got the right on the right , but you don &apos;t know where you don &apos;t have a straight on a right ?
You don &apos;t have a straight on your own facts . Neading your own facts .
And I &apos;ve done a while about it to realize that .
A teenaged a story of years ago , I wrote a story about inently narratives .
I was connected to underneath , against what in fact , the most effective measures for the public health public health .
I didn &apos;t know well what I do , so I wrote a story and I went on .
A little bit later , I wrote a story of genetically depleasure .
With the self-de, but it turns worse .
People are challenge .
So I wrote there , but a story , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people who understand this is a frankening , why they thought that the moleculate of molecules on a framework , instead of an accidentage , a government against nature .
Mear , I know , I &apos;m doing what I wrote . I wrote a story and I wrote a story and I &apos;m now once journalism ; we &apos;re going to do it , we &apos;re going to eat and that &apos;s date .
But these stories continuing me view , I couldn &apos;t make it extremely required .
And because the fanaticians who made me , in fact , no fanaticians .
They were challenging , right issue .
like the people in this business .
And it was just that what me was so solid .
But then I thought , well knows , let &apos;s just be honest : We are at a moment in this world , we &apos;re not in this world , as I think , as a well-empathy as welry .
We &apos;re talking about twins .
We &apos;re talking about ironically as between as between the tackle .
Take advantage .
OK, there are reasons , and I think we also know that we know them .
We lose the belief in institutions , in the science , and then in science , and there is no reason why no reason why no reason .
You only have to drop a couple of names and understanding people .
Tsjernobyl, the Challenge Viox, mass destroyl, mass destruction destruction , not good perceived ponline .
I mean , you can see yourself , you can put together your list together .
There are questions and problems with those people that we thought they always equally easy .
So , you &apos;re skeptics .
Imagine asking , question and evidence and evidence of al, you don &apos;t have anything .
But now , if you get evidence , you &apos;ve got to address them , and you don &apos;t have to be so good .
And the reason I can say that is that we &apos;re now in an unprecently angstep that we hope that it will be going to be left as possible .
About 12 years , there was a horrible story published that a connected between the epidemic of autism and the inenting against majority and the instance against majority .
Angsting .
And hopefully check out to go , or this true .
And that &apos;s a very severe seekend .
The data came up .
She found in the United States , in English , in Swedish , in Cand, and in Cand, and all the result , not at least .
But it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter because we think of anecdotes, we believe what we &apos;re seeing and what we think , and what we think we really think .
We cannot believing a lot of a sacrify government institution that we all of that data on the past , and I think we all that art .
But you know water ?
The consequences were catastrophic , and it &apos;s about this : The United States are one of the few countries in the world where the number of intings against the majority and down at game .
And that &apos;s a shake , and we should be harm .
Take terribly .
What &apos;s going to do about that we were able to decide that we could decide there ?
And I understand what I understand .
Who &apos;s going to get a few of these ?
Have anybody of this audience ever see anybody &apos;s going to die of mazingly ?
Don &apos;t often .
And here &apos;s not multiple , but it happened last year , 160,000 times in the world .
That &apos;s a lot of killed by maze , 20 per hour .
But because it &apos;s not going to be here , we can involve the relatively , and people like Jenny McCarthy Banny McCarthy and disperity in exciting things like Oprah and Larry King .
And they can do that because they can &apos;t make a distinct between ordinary and accidental conditions .
They don &apos;t really understand that these things look , but it &apos;s practical practical .
And that &apos;s something that we need to learn and that we need to teach , and that we need to teach existence .
This guy was a bright , Jonas Salky .
And he &apos;s the most of us of one of our worst .
No anxiety , no death multiple multiple , Polios .
And that man in the middle .
It &apos;s called Paul Offith .
He developed a variety of the clip against the clip of the mental mental .
The rescued the lives of such as 400,000 to 500,000 kids in the third world .
Good , right ?
Well , except that Paul is good except with practice of prospital and how they &apos;re living .
and that people should stop them to stop yourself .
And that &apos;s what he says it .
So Paul is a terrorist .
If he &apos;s a public deaths , it can only be in resembling .
He gets home telephones because there are people who are price to say they know where his kids are school lunch .
And what &apos;s what Paul has been doing is that Paul has developed .
I don &apos;t have to say it , but I don &apos;t need to be unreceived .
Take them out and the diseases will return terrible disease , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
We have back in this country , and back .
And it &apos;s still brief , soon , there will be kids going to die if there &apos;s enough disease .
And they will not only be easy and killing .
What about smallpolio ? That &apos;s what police ?
And a former fellow employee for me weeks , and said she said , &quot; She said , &quot; She said , &quot; She said , &quot; What they &apos;re going to do .
No one has ever sleeval me that ever hit me .
She wasn &apos;t replicate her child .
In no case .
Good .
What &apos;s the equire we don &apos;t know any polio . And you know watching ?
Yesterday , polio didn &apos;t prevent anymore .
More , I think , of course , this morning , maybe somebody on an airplane in Lagos, and he &apos;s flying to Los Angeler , he &apos;s now above right now .
Within a couple of hours , a car , and it comes to Long to Long behind , where he &apos;s going to sit down to one of those fantastic TED dinner .
And he doesn &apos;t realize that he is with a paralyzed disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s the date .
That &apos;s the planet for us .
We rather touching us in a sense .
Have everyone tomorrow are vitamentors ?
Echinacea little bit of an oxide for the day ?
I know because half the Americans every day .
They &apos;re allowing it , and they use alternative medicine , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we discovering that they need to express .
The data is always reinforces again .
They don &apos;t make your urine dark . And practical never practical .
OK , if you want to spend 28 dollars for dark urin , Dan , you know , Dan is that .
Dark . Dark .
Why do we do that ? I think I understanding it , we hate Big Pharmation .
We hate the government . We &apos;re hate that police .
That has to cooking . Our healthcare reward .
They are that for millions of our country .
They are amazingly heard and detected even for those of us that they can permiterent .
So we &apos;re walking away from it , and where we walk ?
We &apos;re in the arms of Big Placeboard .
Damazing . I love Big Placeboard .
Mealization , this is very , very , because the entire mess is message , and we give it to express .
I &apos;ve got a few of those things here .
Gink , chinacaim , chinacai , I don &apos;t even know what that isn , but we don &apos;t even know what that isn , but we &apos;re going to give you some of the argument of dollars ,
And you know water ? If I &apos;m telling the people against me , and they seize , and they say , what can you get ? Let the people .
They feel good about it .
And you know water ? You are mistakes .
I &apos;m not going to care about whether it &apos;s the secretary of the health service of the health service service , I &apos;m not going to be a consequence to what my experts about mammography .
or the other cancer cancer cancer that has been treating coffee .
And if you start to replace evidence and science by believable and magic , then you end to end .
Then you get in the South Africa of Thabo Minki .
He &apos;s responsible for 400,000 people of his people from being able to operate that babroots , buttton and quote , buttton and quote , viral resources that can travel the death of AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of non-thousands of nation in a country that has been planted by this disease .
Don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t tell me that these things .
They have .
Now , the most thoughtful epidemic of epidemic that we now have the absurd of genetic extent to the publishing of genetically malization and the organic engineering .
It &apos;s an idisease . It &apos;s got to stop .
It &apos;s about today , metaphors .
It &apos;s ideology , no science .
Everything that we cut , every single of richness , every single thing is extremely challenge , is because of human beings is mutaneously mutaneously .
Now , if you don &apos;t think there in the empathy of mandards are not a mandards of wareness of wareness .
It wasn &apos;t a water meloent .
Even no Christbs bomb . They all come from ourselves .
and we &apos;re having them in the last 1,000 jarently .
Some of those products bird and others had the none .
We &apos;re not exploration of what we don &apos;t .
Now , we can do a little bit more regulately .
En, certainty there are risks to connection .
But we can produce rice to produce millions of producing millions of life and longer .
You don &apos;t want to address ?
I &apos;ve got to say , that I don &apos;t understand .
We don &apos;t want genetic modified .
And what about what ?
Well , this is a lot of chemist : too many chemicals , pesticidences , monoculary , monocultural , monoculary , we don &apos;t want to be a giant fields of the air .
We don &apos;t love companies that take patents of living on living dinner .
We don &apos;t want the property rights property rights .
And you know what I answered on that ?
You have a similar . Let &apos;s do something about it .
It &apos;s value . Our problem is overwhelmed , but that &apos;s not a science .
It has nothing to do with science .
This is going to be the morality , patent .
Science is not a society .
No land .
Even no ideas . It &apos;s a processional .
It &apos;s a proces, and sometimes it works and sometimes .
But the idea that we need to prevent the science to prevent her work because we &apos;re really afraid of it , and will heat millions of people to heat the only well-origin .
Weat jump , in the next 50 years , we will need more to 70percent more requires than moving .
70s .
This is a graph the distance of the investment in Africa for the last 30 year .
Schandaled . Schandalgory .
They really need it , and we remember it .
And the reason ? Genetical public realization .
We don &apos;t want people to be a minority as a cassave example , as a cassave examples .
Cassave is the daily affecting a half a regulately afford .
It just has a lot of calory .
It &apos;s not enough for provide , as protein , and scientists have been doing something about that .
almost people can eat without blind .
They wouldn &apos;t answer , and you know water ?
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t cute a heart , but it would be fine .
And all I have to say , &quot; Why are we display ?
I mean , let &apos;s remember , why are we suddenly that ?
that we don &apos;t want to share with gene ?
This is going to be transmit from gene . Have nothing to do with chemicals .
Also , not even with our ridiculous passion for hormonths , our desire , better and special event .
It &apos;s not about Rice Krief , it &apos;s about people in life .
and it &apos;s going to be that we start to understand what that is going .
Are you going to know watch ?
If we don &apos;t do it and continuous as we are going to be able to do it , we &apos;re dealing about something that we don &apos;t want to be bully to be : a mind tech colonialization .
I don &apos;t find any other way to describe this better .
It &apos;s self-size and longer , our indigames , and we need to really do something about it .
So , after this unimaginable resource , maybe you &apos;d like to say , you &apos;d like to say , with this ridiculous timelity of travel .
Absolute , I want to date date .
Now , she &apos;s still figured out in the present , but we have an amazing probabilities .
We can do it for all that time for all we want to use .
We can bring them to a sense of them , and we &apos;re going to bring them to where we are wild .
We &apos;ve got to continue with these appropriate , and we need to keep nail , but if we &apos;re going to keep and forward , we &apos;ll be happy to be happy .
I know that we have the artistic , and that , for what to me to me , something that the world needs to science .
Thank you .
Thank you .
A folumnist of the Los Angeles Times--
Steve Lopezy , walking on a day ...
through the center of Los Angelescape
when he heard music .
It came from a male .
A black male .
Charter , label labor , homeless .
And it was played on a violent , but two string .
I &apos;m telling now that many of you all science
because the column of Steve the basic ...
for a view of a movie .
Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Steve Lopez...
and Jamie Foxx who of Nathony Ayers...
the classic showed --
those are more likely to recognize career ,
because he was suffering a schizophrenia .
Nathanel stopped with the Juilliard-conservatory , length --
And 30 years later , he swimming homeless .
by the poorest streets of Los Angeler .
You should read Stest of Stest , you should read the movie .
It &apos;s just for the beautiful band-...
that died between these two male .
But also to see which role music playful music .
a instrumental role , if I say that I say ,
to Nathaniel from the street .
I met Ayers in 20088...
two years in a Disney-concertal .
And he had happiness to an execution of the 1th and 4th symphony of the methovens --
and backstage and represented .
He spoke on a job and social realizes
Yeah , you know , about Yeah and Hillary Clinton .
And it said that the Dodgers never said the World Series .
All of attached to a tricky fours ,
in the last part of the fourth symphony of the ethovens .
We talked about music . Later , I got a mail from Stevehicles
that was wrote that Nathaniel like to a violate me .
You have to know that Nathaniel doesn &apos;t want to be treatment .
When he was treated when he was treated shocket therapy .
chlorpromopazine and handbooishine ,
and that has draw it for his life .
And the result is that he &apos;s nuseful .
attacks of schizophrenia .
The worst of the worst attacks
please ,
and he disappears .
And he &apos;s going to talk about the street ...
and the welling with that narrativity and the worder in his head ,
that following up at the time .
Nathaniel invented in such an agitated state ,
when we understanding our first lesson .
He had a manic gloance in situation .
He was gone .
And he talked about ...
invisible demons and smoke ...
and somebody who wanted him in sleep him in sleep .
I was bang .
Nargument for self-meeting .
that I &apos;ve lost him to calculate .
that he would left out of sweeks in sweek ,
and that I would be relationship to the violent ,
when I started talking about toon-lash ,
and arpeggiot , and other exciting examples .
from what you to view with vioil lessons .
So I started playing .
And I played the first part of the vio-concert of the vioil .
As I playful .
I think of a clear changing .
in the eyes of Nathania .
It was like an invisible medicine his work .
A chemical reaction that my game
the catalyst of catalyze .
The manic window of Nathanielian
changed in understanding .
In silly news yesterday news , and free .
As a wonder packages , he such a square of their own source .
and started playing on it .
Take the fragments of viownership --
that I &apos;m going to recognize . Mendelss ,
Taikovsynsyche .
We began to talk about music , from Bach...
to be ethoven and Brahms...
Brug , all the Buknership .
From Bartter to Esa-Peka Salonene .
I mean , I don &apos;t know .
a encyclopedical musical musical knowledge ,
but he was touched by that personally .
And he talked about it with the meaning .
and it &apos;s understanding and message of my mind ,
from the Los Angeles Philharmons .
By making music and about music ,
This guy changed .
from the paranoid .
that right ?
from Los Angeles had been comentence
in a charmante,
brilliant , classically writing musicus .
Music maeds . Music changes .
For Nathaniel is a healthy .
And by music , he can be able to his mind
and department ,
through his fantasy and creativity
in reality .
It &apos;s air to head .
They &apos;re troubledged attacks .
I think that the essential of art .
And that &apos;s why we do music .
And that we do something that in all of us ,
deep in our nuclear .
Our extraordinary .
And that we see through our artistic lens...
through our crativity that allowed to reality .
The reality of that expressions --
Take our bottom .
We &apos;re going to inspired , inspired and united .
Nathanield
Actually cut through music a group of friends .
The reason of music brought it back .
in a family of musician ...
who assuming him ,
those are talents of them --
and he respected him .
I &apos;m going to stay music with Nathaniel.
It &apos;s now in Walt Disney Concert Hall isen .
or on the street . He reminds me of it .
why I &apos;ve been a musicus .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Robert Gup .
I want to play something that I &apos;ve got to play something that I &apos;ve taken out of cellists .
It &apos;s meaning .
I &apos;m Jane McGongal. I &apos;m a game designer .
All 10 years , I &apos;ll do online game .
And my goal for next decade is to make it as easy to make it easy to save the world as it is in game .
Now , I &apos;ve got a plane for a plane , and that plan is to convince more human , to spend more time to spend more time to the play of bigger and better game .
At this time we play three of the week online game .
Some of you think , more likely , that &apos;s a lot of time to play games .
Perhaps too much of time , there are so much more important problems in the real world .
But actually , I think , in my research at the Institute For the Toes , which is the opposite where issue .
Three on hours a week for a week for long enough to solve problems .
And I believe that if we want to take the next century on this planet , that we have to increase that number enormously .
I have realized that we need for 21 a.m.
And that &apos;s a strange ideas , so I &apos;ll be able to say , I &apos;m going to make it sense .
And if we want to make sure problems like hungry , climate change , global conflict , worldwide , I believe we need to try to play weekicks at least 21 a.m. , I mean , in the end of the next decades to the end of the next decade of the Neum.
This is the reason . This picture is a fairly good together why games are so important for the future of humanity . Really .
This is a portrait by a photographer , Phil Toleddance .
He wanted to catch the games of the games .
So he put a camera for gamers of gamers ,
And this is a classical realizes .
Number , if you don &apos;t gamer gammer games a little bit of a challenge in this picture .
You can see the sense of the feeling , a little bit angusting , but also intense consistence , a deep focus to a very hard problem .
And if you gamer a gamer down here , you &apos;ll have a couple of nuances : the view and mouth is a sign of optimismely .
The women brows are a sign of surprisingly .
This is a gamer that &apos;s at the point of something that &apos;s hot .
Ah , you know . Okay .
So we have a couple of gamers here .
It &apos;s an extremely positively positive , which is so incredibly positively positive , that you didn &apos;t know it was positively positive .
It was almost not to imagine .
And when you go down there , you &apos;re a surprised to figure out what you &apos;re really maintainly art .
This is a gamer at the point of view of view ,
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problems around the world , we &apos;re going to try to packaging for the next century .
The face of somebody , against all the expectations , at the point is to be exciting an empathy profit .
But unfortunately , we see this face in the daily life , we &apos;re trying to packaging problems .
This is what I think I think of Ben National in the Laware calling .
And this is me actually a towe. Can you can see the facility ? Ja. Good .
This is I &apos;m going to be Ben National in the Levelusion .
This is a piece graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeling California , where I did my PhD about why we are better in games than in the real life .
And this is a problem that a lot of gamers .
We don &apos;t feel good in the reality , as we are in games .
And I mean , not just successfully successful , even though that &apos;s part of it .
We &apos;re going to be a little bit more in game . But I mean , but I mean , I also mottively motivated to work together .
And when we are in a game world , I believe that most of us the best version of ourselves word the best version of ourselves , the most likely to multiply to length .
the most likely to be as long as it is requires as long as it is to remain , to a failure .
And if we were in the real life , a failure , when we &apos;re confront , when we &apos;re confront of a failures , we don &apos;t feel like that .
And we &apos;re feeling our overwhelmed . We feel overwhelmed .
We feel frustrated , maybe depressed us , frustrated or cynishes .
We never have those feelings when we &apos;re games .
They &apos;re not existence .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was to washing for a moment .
What makes part of games is it impossible that we don &apos;t feel anything ?
How can we take those feelings of games , and they apply to work in the real world ?
So , I looked games like Word of War-wearing games , which is the ideal cooperative environment to solve problems .
And I began to realize that I began to represent to bring to a worldwide .
The first thing I noticed is that every time you &apos;re in one of those online games , particularly World of the wildlife that you like to have a global reason for a global reason that you are like a global reason for me , measure .
But not just a mission , a mission that mission is a mission that &apos;s appropriately extremely your living in games . Yisten ?
Dush , you can do it .
They never give you a challenge you don &apos;t .
But it &apos;s on the performance of your opportunity . So you &apos;ve got to do a lot of this .
But there &apos;s no employment in World of Warld of wildlife .
You can &apos;t sit down .
There &apos;s always something specific and important that has to be done .
And there &apos;s a lot of contribute .
Every place where you galay , there are hundreds of thousands of people who are willing to be your epic mission .
And that &apos;s something that we &apos;re in the real life difficult , that sense that there is a lot of collaborators .
And also that there &apos;s an epic story , this invent story that tells us why we are here and what we do .
And then all the positive feedback that we get genuine .
You &apos;ve already heard of a living riches and plus-force an intelligence .
Supping constant back-stream , we get into the real life .
When I here from this stage , I will not get a message , I won &apos;t get any mountain , plus-up ideas .
I don &apos;t get feedback in the real life .
Number the problem with collaborative online worlds like Warld of Warld Warld of Warld Warld Warld of a supports , that we decided to spend up our time to spent our own time to spent our time on games .
It &apos;s just better than reality .
So far now , World of Warld Warld Warld wine , 5.93 million years to spend the virtual problems of Azeroth to solve the virtual problems of Azeroth .
Number that &apos;s not a bad thing .
It sounds maybe bad .
In order to make that clearly clear , 5.93 million years ago , our first of all ,
That was the first primary , directly initial primary .
And so , as we are as we investing about the amount of time that we investing in the game of game is the only way to think about it is to even knowledge to even knowledge of time in the context of the evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
But it &apos;s also display . It turns out to be a lot of time to play with so much time to play with the game of measuring , we &apos;re going to change as people .
We evolve to a kind of more cooperative and education .
This is what I believe .
Duses think about this interesting .
It was published by a researcher of the Carnegie Mellon University .
The average young medium , in a country with an important game cultural game , it &apos;s already going to engaged for the time he &apos;s 21 years old .
Numbers is a very interesting digit for two reasons .
Ten hearing , for kids in the United States is 080 hours , the exact amount of time that you spent at school from the fifth reading the fifth year until your studies as you always appropriate .
So , we have a wine wildlife of education where young young learning about the games like they do a lot of the games in schools .
Some of you have a memory of Malcom Gladell-empathy of Outlider .
So , you &apos;ve heard of his successful theory , the existence theory .
It &apos;s on this wonderful , cognitive scientific research is based that if we can control for a long study , for a long study , we can control for a long study that we have 21 struddenly virtual in struggling .
We &apos;re going to be a very good at what we do as the best we do as the best of the world .
And what we &apos;re seeing now is a whole generation young of generation in the game .
Duses , the big question , of Where are becomes so good for massive reality .
Now , if we can behind that , we would be virtual unprecedented to human potential .
This is the number of people who are now in the world at least hours a day games .
These are our virtuoes .
500 million people who are very good at extraordinary .
And in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have an extraordinarily good at gamers that extraordinary good at something .
If you don &apos;t remember it yet .
The gaming-industry is consools to develop that very little current and needs with wireless telephone networldbing Internet so that gamers of all over the world , mostly in Indian , mostly in Indian , mostly can play of playing around the world .
They expect to be a meaning of gamers against the decades .
And that brings us to 1.5 m.
So , I just wondered by these games like this games of the members of virtuoches .
I &apos;ve got four meaning for the first fire is fire .
Okay , you can see as extreme self-motivation .
Brand-optimism is the wants to be a handle , to combined a heart , combined with believing that we have a reasonable opportunity on success .
Gammed always believe that a massive wild of wind , and that it &apos;s always worthy is to be able to do , and then now .
Gamers night .
Gammers are virtual in the weight of a poet social standards .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that we have people rather after we have a play with them , even though they have a play with them .
The reason is that you need to play with somebody .
We confidence that they &apos;re going to continue with their time , that they will be played to play for the rest .
So a play with somebody , the bottom bandards the bottom and the collaboration .
And as a consequence , we actually build more social relationship .
Salive productivity .
You know , there &apos;s a reason , that the average World of Warld , 22 hours a week playful for 22 hours a week .
That &apos;s because we know that when we play a game , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we received or anywhere .
We know that as people are made to delivered , useful work .
And gamers are willing to work hard , when they give the right work , if they give the right work .
And finally , epic meaning .
Gammers are like to received from planetary crime , stories of planetary scales .
It &apos;s a small wett to be a small wett .
You &apos;re all Wikipedia , the biggest wiki in the world .
The biggest wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 articles , is the World of the World of Warld ,
Five million people use it every months .
They have more info about World of Warld of Warld Warld Take sitting on the Internet any other topic .
They build an epic story .
They build a epic source of knowledge about World of Warling .
So , those are four superforces that are combined to one thing .
Gamers are super-engineering , hopeful ,
These are people who believe that they believe that they &apos;re allowed to change the world .
And the only problem is they believe that they have to change virtual worlds and not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to figure out .
There &apos;s an economist , Edward Castrono .
His work brilliant . He seeks the reason why people spend so many time and energy and spend on online global .
And he &apos;s saying , we &apos;re telling , not less than a real massive mass exoso to virtual worlds and online meworldview .
And he &apos;s a economist , so he &apos;s rational rational .
And he gt... Nextinct , I &apos;m a game design .
But he &apos;s saying this , because gamers can make more of gamers in a world than in the real life .
They can have more social relationships in games than in the real life .
They get better feedback and feel more likely in games than in games .
So he says it &apos;s perfectly logical that gamers spend more time in virtual worldings than in real world .
Number , I &apos;m going to ask that rational , at this moment .
But it &apos;s not an optimal situation .
We have to do the real world in a game more lifetime .
So I &apos;m going to take my realization of something that 2,500 years ago .
This is an ancient dobusiness , made of sheep knowledge . Okay ?
For we had these controllers , we had challenging cool .
And this is the first piece of tools for that , designed by mental .
And if you &apos;re working the ancient Greek historian Herodotus knowledotus , maybe this story .
the inventors of the first game and why they invented it .
Herodotus says that played , particularly , particularly invented in the room Lydia during .
And apparently , the hunrequired of Lydia decided that the king of Lydia decided to do something .
People lift . People flights .
It was an extreme situation . They had to have an extreme for an extreme for .
Duses Herodotuses , they found out business baggery and a massive policy .
One day , eat each one day .
The next day , plays everyone plays .
And they would be solid bottomed in their playing , because they play are so book , and damn us under us in such as such as extraordinary productivity that they wouldn &apos;t eat .
The next day , they played games .
The day after it was search .
And then Herodotus , they had this 18 years .
They survived a famine by eating one day , and the next day .
And I think this is exactly how we use games today .
We use games to emerge from the real world .
We &apos;re using them to escape from everything that was broken in the real world , everything that &apos;s not happiness to the real world , and we get what we need of game of game .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end .
This is very exciting .
After 18 years , Herodotus didn &apos;t get the hungry .
So the king that they were going to decided that they were going to play a finishing business .
She &apos;s empowering the entire quick in two .
And they played one deaths , and the winners of that game on a epic adventory .
They would be Lydia latene , and looking for a new hell .
At enough people living in order to survive of the lifestyles that there are more wareness , and hopefully they could leave the civilization .
Number this sounds , right ?
But recently showed DNA evidence that the Etrusk , who would lead to the Roman , for DNA as the ancient Lydiells .
And so , scientists have suggested that Herodotuses telling story .
And geologists invented from a climate change that nearby 20 years that almost expensive the hungered .
So this crazy story could be true .
It could be that they saved their culture by playing games by playing games to a game for 18 years , and then inspired so much about 18 years , and then inspired so much of the games that they save their entire civilization in that way they save their whole civilization in that way .
Okay , we can .
We &apos;re playing Warity since 1994.
It was the first time the strategy time strategy of the World of the World of extremely .
And they played with dozen during 18 years of us play , we play for 16 years .
I &apos;m saying that we &apos;re ready for our own evil game .
Number , for half the population of the population looking for a new global .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do for 21 a.m.
We &apos;re going to leave half our agreement a day in order to we have problems in the real world .
Now , I know what you &apos;re asking for you to ask : How are we going to empowering that problems of Wel, which is where I &apos;ve been dedicated to the last couple of year-old , at the Institute For the Two .
We have a banner in our building in Palo Alto, and it presses our standpoint of how to deal with the future .
We don &apos;t want to predictorious him .
We want to shape him .
We want to represent us to the best possible .
And then we want to give people the meaning to reality .
We want to imagine our presents , and then give people the resources to expressure their employees .
I &apos;ll show you short three games that I &apos;ve made a little bit of that I &apos;ve made a attempt to give people the resources to their own device for the future .
Okay , this is World Without .
We made this game in 20070s .
This is an online game for you to see a text of oil is trying to survival .
The text is fiction , but we &apos;re telling enough online content to believe that it really , and to make you believe that it , and to make you real life as though we don &apos;t have any more . Dus, if you don &apos;t start the game game , you &apos;re telling your heart , you &apos;re telling where you hot .
And then we give you real-time currently , and data that show you what the exact price of oil , which is not available , how the exactly available , how transportation is influenced , or the schools of the schools of the schools of the schools of the schools of the schools .
And you have to figure out how to live your real life as if this true . And then we ask you a blog about it . And then we ask a blog about it , to be a blog of video .
We started this game with 1,700 players in 20070s .
And we followed them for the three years .
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
Nobody wants to be changing their lifewise , but because it &apos;s good for the world or because we should be told .
But if you didumpe them in an epic adventure , and they don &apos;t have an oil multimate .
This is an amazing story and adventure to gain .
And that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to see how you would survive .
The deaths helped their habits that they learned in this games .
Dus, for the next world-reason , we decided to make higher bigger problems than an oil .
We made a play called Superstruct struck at the Institute For the Toes .
And the plot was that a supercomputer had realized for 23 years .
And this supercomputer was the name of Global Extinction Awareness System .
We asked people to come up online , almost as a Jerry Bruckheimer .
You know what , Jerry Brubkheimer , you shapes a threw team .
You &apos;ve got the astronaut , the scientists , the ex-prison , and they have to put together the world .
But in our games , we have five people on the dream of five people on the thream team , and it &apos;s your job to findings , and it &apos;s your job to findings , the employment of the health , the providing of the health , the conceived of security and the social networks .
We showed 8,000 people play the game during eight weeks .
And they spend 500 tremendous creatively resources that you can see if you &apos;re on Google for the extremely search .
And then finally , the last game , we bring it out on three magic . This game is made in collaboration with the World Bank Institute .
If you played the game out , you will be certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Institute as a Social Institutory .
With universities all over World African , and we invitation them to teach social engineering .
We have a pulled comic . We have a system with levels in skills like local insizes , knowledge , sustainability , vision and invental .
And I &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game please with young , all over the world , especially in the development areas that could be the advantage ; to make their own social entrepreneur to save the world .
So I &apos;ll now go around .
I want to ask a question .
Now , what think of it &apos;s going to happen now ?
We &apos;ve got all these great gamers, we have these games that are just what we could do , but no of them has the real world .
Well , I hope you &apos;re going to be able to do with member , that gamers an aid source , which we can use to heal the real world , that games are a powerful platform for changing .
We have all this incredible superssive productivity , the possibility of productivity , the possibility to be a poet , this sense of burning optimism and the desire to a epic significant .
And I really hope that we can come together to play games that a difference , for this planet , to be a difference on this planet .
And my hope is that you make with me games and play games .
And if I look forward to the next decades , I know two things that we can imagine , that we can imagine , and we can play every game that we can play for every game .
Dush , I hit , leaves the world changing play .
Thank you .
Since I &apos;ve been interested in the case of the real-effectory .
It can seem strange for a magicious , unless you know , unless you &apos;ve got to be a measured of something that &apos;s extremely check by somebody believed that it really wordd-to-effect Meet of Merpills have a measure-effect , the studies of the challenges effect .
Just because the presence of issue , that what &apos;s what &apos;s happening to him is a genetic resources or something else --
For it with painful , particularly , if they dangy in believed , it gets a measurable bodies effectable , the process of an effectors .
Something that needly becomes the perception .
To make sure that we understand each other , I want to start with you a very simple structure .
And I &apos;m going to show you how the towards the towards the 1950s since the 1950s for children .
I &apos;ve been tiny for him as a little boy to the scale in the 1960s .
I &apos;ll explain the trick , I &apos;m going to explain it .
And after that , I explain why I explained him .
This is what happened .
You can visit . my hand, you can visit .
I &apos;m going to hold it in this way , I &apos;m going to hold it in this way .
I &apos;m going to my mind my little clip .
And in order to be that there or out of my muses , I &apos;ll get here in my powers .
You see that there isn &apos;t a movement .
I &apos;m going to check here for a long , can nothing in my mind .
The goal is very simple .
I &apos;ll open my hand , and hope , if it &apos;s good ism , my magnetism will be humane .
The knife becomes so celebrated , that I can shake it , and it &apos;s not on the soil .
Nothing comes in or from my mind , not cheating . And you can observe anything .
Ta-day !
This trick , I &apos;m often on young kids who are interested in magician , because you can learn a lot about a lot of learning by studying it .
Even throughout the trick of the trick of each other .
Probably a lot of you know this truck .
This is what happened .
I love it .
I say I &apos;m telling my wrip , to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in and from my muses .
That &apos;s supposed .
The reason I &apos;m holding my wrist is because in the secret of the illusion of illusion .
At the moment , my hand moved from your view of your view , my wise finger from his original site to one of his original place .
Moomi tricks to empowered by the way .
It &apos;s going to push .
And if I turn into my fingery .
And we can argue about it , why we don &apos;t notice that there &apos;s only three fingers visible .
That &apos;s because the brain information information in a way that it doesn &apos;t , two , three counter-telligent .
But it doesn &apos;t really go , right ? And then I &apos;ll do my hand .
Of course , it doesn &apos;t depend on magnetism , but by the presence of the presence of my wisdom .
And if I close my hand , the self-de.
And when I turn into the weather , this movement for me to retreat my finger .
And I &apos;ll heal this hand . You reach it out .
A beautiful tricky for friends and family relationship . Thanks .
Now , what does this have to do with the evil of the wood-effectory ?
About a year ago I read a research that I read the eyes are completely opened .
I &apos;m not a scientists , so for me was this amazing thing .
It turns out that if you &apos;re dealing a well-being of a white tours of pill for an afford to an affordable effect on an amazing thing .
Moften as the present of the ebo change , for instance , by a smaller pill , which is colored your blue , and where you get a letter to be a letter , the bo measurer effectively .
Even though , despite of them that no medicine medicine -- they &apos;re sugar pillensions .
But a white pill is not as good as a bluweather .
Do I got really touched from the upper .
But in the excited , it can be a little bit more .
It turns out that capsules are more effectively than which species .
A little bit of a colorgeous capsule of one and red on the other officer is better than a white .
Dosering on this is a role .
A pill twice every day is not as good as three pillense -- I can &apos;t remember the statistics .
But the point --
It &apos;s going to play a role .
And the empathy is a role .
And for the ultimate for the ultimate of the ultimate .
Ja, toch? A injection spoke a little injectory of a kind of cently injectory of a sort of injectively injectively .
This is an enormously powerful image .
It &apos;s lots of minds more than the white piles .
We &apos;re going to leave a graph view , when we can show the extinct of diac .
The point is not as good as the blueful pill is not as good as the blue , is not as good as the capability .
And no one of all has a real medicine property .
Just your believing it really in your body , and it &apos;s a stronger effectory .
I wanted to see if I could look at that idea in a trick .
I wanted to take something that &apos;s a trick , and really make it living .
We know from that research that when you wild reality , you have to grabbs .
This is a needle of nearly 18 inches . She &apos;s volved .
I &apos;m going to get her a little bit of sterilize .
This is really my meat . This is not a particularly growing meat .
This is my skin . This is not a Hollyword spectrum .
I &apos;m going to spend my skin on this needle through my arm , until I go through it .
And when you go down , you know , if you &apos;re easy flawfalls , I did this trick yesterday for a couple of friends and some people I don &apos;t know .
A woman was almost of her stick .
So , I &apos;m supposed to that if you remember the next 30s -- you know , I &apos;m doing the first heavy part .
You can look away , but you can look away .
This is what happened .
Meaning my poorest , I make a small glash .
Sorry, man. Are you this misconversation ?
And then by my skin piece , and then through the other side .
Well , in essence , we &apos;re in essentially situation as with the measures .
A species .
But you can see my fingers , right now ?
I &apos;ll show them . Here &apos;s one , two , three-, fifth .
Ja...
I know people think when they &apos;re in this size .
They don &apos;t know , he &apos;s a meaning enough for themselves , for a few minutes , for a few minutes .
Now , what does that look like that ?
Ja, I know what the people in the back in the back of the room , I don &apos;t think of the Okay , that &apos;s the massive means today at the screen lights .
Let me show you this close to you .
That &apos;s really my skin . That &apos;s not a Hollywood spectrum .
That &apos;s my business . I can pull it out a little wireless .
Sorry. If it &apos;s too much struggle , look away and don &apos;t go to that dingle .
People in the room or people in the room or seeing of the meaning of the massive , it looks like a beautiful spectrum , but if it really washing -- there &apos;s a gap there . If it really would be there . If it really , he would say , well , if it really would be the blood blood working blood workers for the blood years .
Ja, there is .
Normally , I would be removed the needle .
I was going to make my arm and show you that there &apos;s no swonder .
But in this context , and with the idea of something that is that neighborhood and it really makes me the needle and I &apos;m so from the stage .
The next days , I &apos;m going to be several days .
And so , you look at that . Thank you very much .
I have a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve been having two .
The first thing seemed more to a passionate affairement .
It was a beautiful fishering , good structures , multi-self-self-self-self-self-a-realize .
What a fish .
In fact , it was a fairly growing fish to the assumption of sustainability .
So you felt good at the sales .
I had a relationship with this beauty for maand-a-for maand-a-during mass .
And one day , the head of business and asked me if I wanted to speak to talk at a means of the issue of the issue .
Absolutterly , said .
Here was a company that was tried to solve that something that was unimaginable for our tubes .
How do we love fish ?
In the past 50 years , we &apos;ve got the sea for the last 50 years .
It &apos;s difficult to overdrive .
90 percent of the major fishing , which is the tune , the heillions , the salm , sword fishing , sword fishing .
There &apos;s almost nothing more .
Dush , how good it or bad it also ga-fishery , fishery is part of our future .
although there &apos;s a lot of arguments .
Vishing pollums , the althanks of them are althanks , they are inefficiency .
A big mindset .
It has a self-self-conversion of 1.
And that means that there is fish wildlife in order to get a pound .
Next very sustainable .
And it doesn &apos;t make very good .
So here was a company that it was trying to do good .
I wanted to support them .
The day for the empaign , I called the head PR of the company .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
Two , Donteller , for the facts of the facts , you &apos;re not going to be pollutting it so far in sea .
Now , that &apos;s closely right now , and we &apos;re so far from the coastal , that it has spread of our fish , and not concentrating .
And he added ,
Which conversion is 2.5 to 12.5 to 100th , aware of extremely extremely the massively of extraordinary .
2.5 to 15 , wonderful .
Two and a half a watch ? What massive aquatic examples .
Two protein , since said .
Gewellent , said the phone . And the telephone .
And that night , I was in bed and , which is what is a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , I called for the realization , I called Don.
I said , &quot; I think of Don, which are sustainable protein
He said he wouldn &apos;t stop it . He was going around .
So I &apos;ve been on the line with a number of people in the business .
Nobody could answer me a clear me .
until I finally got the main biologist .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
Dong Dontaneously , which is a couple of sustainable protein
Good , he called the Gudge of meals , and then he said chicken chicks .
I &apos;m like , I &apos;m looking at Kiballtjestigation
He said , he &apos;s a Jaware , common catched , malcular , shawed and processing to make sense of the measurest of the malory .
I say , &quot; I &apos;m going to -- whose percentage of your feet .
All of knowledge , eight .
Nouth , that &apos;s about 30 cently procently .
And I think , as a Don, which is sustainable to figure out of fishing .
There was a long pauthem on the line , and he sea , and it &apos;s just too much chicken in the world .
My love for this fish was true .
Neasy because I &apos;m a self-in-fine practice fine practice .
That &apos;s me .
I lost my love for this fish .
This is a fish , which is a very different love story .
It &apos;s the romistic species , the kind of where you get more of your fish , you know more from the fish .
I was first in a restaurant in a restaurant in south Spants .
A birlfriend journalist spoke for a long time .
She has more infortune .
He &apos;s got the table , a bright , almost slow-slowly .
The coat had cookied him .
Almost twice .
And it was pretty amazing , he was pretty .
Who can do a fish so good , after he cooked out to throw ?
I wasn &apos;t , but this guy .
Let &apos;s take him Miguel .
Actually .
And it doesn &apos;t buy the fish , and he &apos;s not cooking .
Ten doesn &apos;t least the way as you and I understand .
He &apos;s a biologist in Veta La Palmoon .
And that &apos;s a fishery in the southweet of Spanity .
At the date of the Gaudalquivir .
Until the &apos; 80s was the vulnery in the hands of tinians .
They &apos;re forced to wasn on what they &apos;re actually dragged .
They did that by drawing the country .
They built a complex canalently and they took the water of the country .
It didn &apos;t want them to recognize economics .
and ecological it was a disaster .
90 percent of the birds went in .
water , for these places , a lot of birds .
And so in 1982 , in 1982 a Spanish environmental ,
What did side of them ?
They turn the water stream .
She &apos;s literally the button .
Instead of push water out , they used the channels to latent water .
She &apos;s the channels of water .
She &apos;s a 1,100 acres big fish big fish , major fish , heart , heart , paling -- and at the same time have Miguel and company have the ecological desert .
The issue is great .
I mean , you &apos;ve never intend something like this .
You know , you know , the horizon the end of the infinite , and you see , all over the channels , and this distraction .
Next so long ago , I was there with Migule .
He &apos;s an amazing venture Charles Darwin and one quarters Darwin and one quarter .
Or ? Kealize his weather , I &apos;m heading and slowed and scientific , sink to muses , and Miguel , gives Miguel , gives a biologeself .
Here he points to a rare Zwar-Schoul-Schoul-Schoul-Schoul-Schoul-Schouthern wind .
Now , he pointed on the mineral needs of the phytoplanguage .
And here he sees a groups here he sees a group of the Tanzanian giraf .
It turns out that Miguel most of his career spent in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he was such a fish expert .
He &apos;s like , he &apos;s Viss ? I don &apos;t know anything .
I &apos;m a relative-expert.m.
And then he talked about rarely rarely and algae and algae and strange water plant .
It wasn &apos;t traffic , it was really fascinating , a kind of biological reality .
It was amazing , but I was in love .
And my head swimming in the cooking piece of high fish that I had the evening for the night .
So I suppose , I brought down . I say , &quot; How does it come your fish so good swells .
He &apos;s going to the algene .
And I know what I &apos;m doing , the algene , the phytoplanking , the relationship , it &apos;s amazing .
But what food is the fish ?
What is the realization of the realm of the well-empathy
And then he &apos;s going to tell me that it &apos;s such a wealthy system , that the fish eat what they would be in the wild .
The plantain biomased biomass , the phytoplanguage , the animal plankly , which is what the fish is the fish of shake .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-incurrently .
There &apos;s no fresh .
East heard of a farm that animals are not feed her animals ?
And I rescuffs about this terrain with Miguel and asked about this with Miguel and assince , I think , is a place that &apos;s kind of rescue for the measure that I &apos;ve ever been to realize , the measurely successful for the most successful for the measured to be successful for the measurescue of the measure
At that moment , it was like a movie director .
And we went around the corner and saw the most wonderful face , thousands and thousands and thousands of pink flamingames , literally a pink for situation .
That &apos;s successful .
Take a look at their gentlement ,
They &apos;re at the party of the party .
Festablished ? I was total confusion .
I said , &quot; Well , they &apos;re not at the party of the party of the feminds
Javor of the meaning , haired .
We &apos;re touching 20 percent of our fish and fish education ,
Last year , this area , over 250 different species , more than 250 different species .
It &apos;s now the biggest and one of the most important private air species are becoming a very deaths .
I said , I think , is a bird population that &apos;s a bird population that doesn &apos;t do good at the last thing you want to see on a fishery of extraordinary extraordinariety .
He showed his head , needge .
And he said , &quot; It &apos;s extensive , not intensive .
This is an ecological network .
The flamingames of food .
The garnals eat the phytopytops .
So , how pull the disease , the better , the more systems
COK, let &apos;s take a minute .
A matter of the animals are not feeding , and a vulnerable to the vulnery of his hunting his hunting .
It &apos;s a fisheries , but also a bird species .
Okay , marries , who should not be swouldn &apos;t have to be sitting here .
They breed in a village 250 miles away , where the bottom conditions are better to build nests to build nests .
Every morning flying , 250 miles into the vulnerable .
and every evening 250 miles .
They do that because they can do that because they can take the subsistance line of the amazing line .
No graphy .
I imagine a penguin , so I looked at Miguel .
I said , &quot; I mean , Mign , they fly 250 kilometers back to the vulnery and then 250 miles ?
Does them that for the young for the young memory
And he looked at me at a Whitney Houstent-song quote .
He &apos;s saying , he &apos;s doing that for the course of Neasy
I have the skin of my loved fish , not even meltain , who I don &apos;t like fish , and I don &apos;t like fish skin .
I don &apos;t like that . I don &apos;t like crawling .
It &apos;s that wrange , teacher .
I &apos;m rarely rarely .
But when I provided him in that restaurant in the south Spanital , he doesn &apos;t make sense of visual skin .
And he made sweet and clean , and clean al-like a hap out of the ocean .
I said to Miguel and he kness .
He works like a sponser .
It &apos;s the last defense before something the body in front of the body .
He &apos;s evolved to southern institutes
And then he added : But then , but our water has no since our water .
OK. It &apos;s a question that &apos;s not fish .
It &apos;s a very success measuring the success of its predator .
And then I realized that when he certainly realized that when he said , a big understatstatement , he made a big understatement , because the water that through the growth of the Guadalquist river .
And that &apos;s a river that &apos;s a river that &apos;s river with rivers of nine , chemical engineering , pesticipating pesticide .
And it &apos;s just by the way the system and thrown away , is the water cleaner than when it came in .
The system is so healthy that the water .
So it &apos;s not just a vulnerous animals , not just a vulnerable to the health of his success to the health of his predataset , but a matter that literally a water soatics .
And not just for that fish , but also for you and miles .
that if the water flows away , it comes in the Atlantic .
A drop in the ocean , I know what it is , but I &apos;m going to take , and you should be killing , because this love high-display , although shame .
You can say that it &apos;s a recipe for the meaning of good , whether we &apos;re seeing about bag .
Now , what we need is a radial new agricultural conceptance , one of the employment is really good .
But for a lot of people is that a little bit of too radicaal .
We &apos;re not realistic , we are nice .
We are love .
We like the farket .
We love little family benefit .
We &apos;re just talking about locally .
We eat organ .
And if you suggesting that these are the things that are the empathy of good empathy , there &apos;s always a churchurch , I love rock out of rock , but how do you go the world nuggle , but how are you going to feed the world ?
How are you going to go into the world .
Can I honest ?
I don &apos;t love that problem .
Neasy because we &apos;re now producing more than enough calories to produce the world .
And one of them leads today &apos;s hungry .
And one of them , and that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the great inequality in department , not the amount .
I don &apos;t like this question , because she &apos;s the logic of the logic of our system for the last 50 years .
Foor grain grain , pesticide , pesticides to monocultural , chemicals to fish , chemistry , chemistry has agricultural to be more people -- how to be a cheaply challenge to the forest of the wall of the things that I think that as I think is a definitely of the wall
That &apos;s the motivation .
It &apos;s the justified .
It &apos;s been the entrepreneur of American agriculture .
We ought to empowered it , an enterprise in liquidation , an entrepreneuring that production right ?
That &apos;s not a support , and it &apos;s not an agriculum .
Our daily bread is now endangered , not by detectory , but by farming source , not by the last combined and tracking the combined language , but by fertilized by fertilyfish , not by clean water , but not by clean water , but by bone .
Do you want the world to nurture ?
Let &apos;s start with the questions , how do we go ?
Now , how can we conditions of conditions for which every single except itself ?
To do that , don &apos;t look at the agries of the future .
It &apos;s old and it &apos;s old and it &apos;s accelerating .
It &apos;s very strong , chemicals and machines and machines, and it never has something really good to eat .
So , instead of looking at the ecological model .
That &apos;s the model that trust on two extraordinary extraordinary job .
Look at Miguel, like Miguel, like Miguel, who don &apos;t know their own worldding , which repaintings re-growing , instead of exciting extensive , which extensive experts of experts that are not just producers in relationship , but the experts in relatively because they are the experts in relatively , because they are the experts in relationship .
And if I very , very honest , they &apos;re a better cock than I will ever be .
You know , I think it &apos;s primary , because if that &apos;s a great deal of issue , then it becomes highly .
Thank you .
I grew up , at a constant diet of a fiction .
At educational education , I went with the bus to school , I went back to school with the bus , every day .
And I was always absorbed by a book , a very fiction book , which involved me in thoughts of other worldly news , and the date memory , my invitable news .
En, knows that &apos;s curiosity , who &apos;s curiosity in the fact that I don &apos;t washing in school , when I don &apos;t washing in school , I was in the forest , wisdom , wellecent , collective , snake and house , inslanguage , insnake and they took it back to the aware of the case cope .
You know , I was a real scientific science .
But it was all about understanding the world , the limits of the potential understanding .
And mine love to be given to be mirror in the world , also seemed to be multiple , because what was happening , this was the accelerator , we went to the months , we went to the monthly ocean , Jacques Cousteau came to the exploring , Jacques Cousteain our habs of exploration , which are amazing , which we can never see our animals and a wonderful world .
This seemed to resonate with the entire equipment .
And I was an artists .
I could draw . I could draw .
And because there were no games of games and these collection of CG , and all of this is alandscape , I think of this is the main realization .
You know what , we had to do , as kids , as a children are reading and the basis of the author something on the author on the basis of author in our heads .
And my reaction about this : painting , painting , drawing , aliens , aliens , aliens , aliens , robotic creatures , all that kind of dinner .
I became constantly traps mathematics sitting behind mathematics .
And that was the creativity that was an extraordinary .
And then something interesting happened about the Jacques Cousteau program , made me very excited about the fact that there was a very excited about the fact that there &apos;s an alien world washing here on the planet .
I wouldn &apos;t really go to an alien world on a day in a spacecraft .
That seemed to be an unlikely .
But that was a world where I could actually employed to actually go here on Earth , which is so rich and exotic washing , if everything that I had imagined me through the reading of that books .
So , I decided to become more subjects of year-old .
And the only problem with that washing , I was a small village in Canada living in Canada , 600 miles of the nearest ocean .
But I &apos;m not scaling there .
And I &apos;m sure at mine in my father until he finally found a disease school in Buffalo, New York , just about the border of the border we lived .
And I got the message of a certification in a swimming pool of a YMCA, in the winter, in Buffalo, New York .
And I think of the ocean , a real ocean , not until two years ago , when we moved to California .
Since service , in the garden ligg-ligent , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under water , and 500 hours of that was in submarine .
And I &apos;ve learned that that deep sea , and even the undeep ocean , and even the undeep ocean with wonderful life .
And the imagination of nature is so limited to our constraints , compared to our limitation ,
Until this lady , I &apos;ve been looking for what I see when I &apos;m seeing these days .
And messy of love for the ocean is still as strong as they &apos;re washing as strong as they ever washing .
But when I as adult as an adult a career , this filmmaker .
And that seemed the best of it , to combine the drop I had to combine stories with my drink to tellent stories .
And as a kid , I was always doing the drawings of comic books , etc .
Films make the way to make sense of the resources . And that seemed , and that seemed .
And the extraordinary that I &apos;m cooks to tell you , excellength of the Terminatory of Aliensis , and it &apos;s extraordinary for the Abysses .
And with The Abysses , I spent The Abysses , I brought in front of water and collaboratory with films .
Say for two passions , the two passions .
Something interesting about the meaning of the Abysses of the Abysses , which is to solve a special technical problem in that movie , the massive of a liquid water , which is a kind of liquid water , CG, surrounded animation .
And this result in the first devices of the sophis-factory , CG , who ever had in a movie .
And even though that the film never brought money , it was closely supported , I had to say , I was a gently genty of something that was the public , that was the public , the world was the public , showed by these seemed magic .
You know what , the employee , you know , that every single separated technology is not too distinced technology of magic .
She saw something magic .
And I became very excited .
and I thought , is something that needs to be able to get into the filmmaticipate in the world
Bush , with a term of the meaning of my view , we were going to be here .
World of ILMs , we empowered the liquid metals in that movie . The success is going to work or that effect .
And that &apos;s what we did . And we remember ,
And we had a result of the public .
All the money we have a little bit more money on that movie .
Bush , to pull a line between those two points of experiencing , totally this becomes a whole new global , a whole new world of creativity .
So I started a company with Stan Winstoning , my good friend Stan Winstonishing make-up designer and creatures in that time and it was a genmital Domainitial Domainitial Domainitial Domainitial Domain .
And the concept of the business was that we were going to make an engaging , over the analog processes of optical printers and we would direct digital production .
And that we did , we actually , and the gave us a competition .
But we found ourselves , in the middle of the 1990s , in the creatures and character design , in the middle of the 1990s .
So , I wrote this piece of genome Avatory of Avatory , that was to supposed to explain the boundaries of visual effects , of realistic human event , realistic human beings in CG . And the world would be the world in CG . And the world would be in CG . And the world would be in CG would be the bounders .
And I was told by the people in mutaneously , that we wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to downside this .
So I put it in the refrigerator , and I made that other film about a big ship that sink .
I sold it to the studio alsize : Tational Romeo and Juuliety of a chickness .
It &apos;s becomes an epic romal , passionate movie .
And what I wanted to do was washing , I wanted to do what I want to do is for the recognization .
And that &apos;s why I make the movie .
And that &apos;s the truth . Echterly knew , studio knew that .
But I convinced hengine . I &apos;m saying , we &apos;re going to go to the walk .
We will use it in opening the film .
It &apos;s going to be very important . It &apos;s going to be a great deal of the measures .
I convinced them an expedition .
Sounds sound . But this comes back at the theme of your imagination that a reality of the reality .
That &apos;s really a reality that we actually reality a reality of a Russian submarine supply later in Russian addition , two and a halfway in the northern Atlantic , looking at the real Titanic of the real Titanic by a path , not a filmed , not a movie , not HDen .
Now , I stelled to the present .
And the most engineering a lot of progress , we had to develop cast camera and lights all kinds of dinner .
But it looked at how much these diverse , these deep tells on spacecraft .
You know what , it was very technical and the most enormous planning .
You get into this dark capsule , your dark down in this dark environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t go back on yourself .
And I thought , as I think of Wown , it &apos;s a very fiction of a fiction movie .
This is very copyright .
And I had the taste of the deep ocean of the deep ocean ,
Nature , the curiosity of curiosity , the science component .
It was the bottom . It was an adventure . It was an imagination . And it was an experience that was an experience that Hollywood .
Now , I know , I was able to realize a weather , and we could have a visual effectively for me . But I couldn &apos;t remember what I was framework .
As we deal with some of our next expeditions , I think of all of our next expeditions , and sometimes things that I had never been seen before , sometimes things that I had ever seen before , who had no one ever seen before , the realization of the science of the science that we saw them and they saw them .
So I was followed by this and more deaths .
And so I made a little more strange decision .
After the success of Titanicycle , I said , I think , as I think , as I &apos;m going to wood for a while Hollywood , and I &apos;m going to take a while you know .
And so we started planning these expeditions .
And we finally went to the Bismarket , and exploring it with robotic vehicle .
We went back to the Titanicken .
We took little boately tiny challenge that we had to examined with glass .
And the idea was to go in and get an inter-investigation of that ship , but never done before .
No one had ever been in the wrap . They didn &apos;t have the resources to door , so we developed technology to do it .
Bush here , I &apos;m zero-on the deck of the Titanic, and look outside of the Titanic, and look outside out to plant a lot of things that look like the band played .
And I cut up a little robot vehicle because of the ship .
And when I say , I say that I collect him , but multimate for the vehicle , I felt as though I was physicist within the creation of the Titanicans .
And it was the most surrelated species that I &apos;ve ever been hatching , because I had ever been hatching for me , because I had been going to be able for the lights of the vehicle of the vehicle , because I had a few months at the time when we make the movie to the movie .
And the set was like an exactly replica on the blueprint of the ship .
So it was an absolutely remarkable experience .
And it made me realizing that the telepresence of the telepression , that you can see , the actual injected attars that you can be injected in the vehicle in the vehicle , in this other well-empowered .
It was really deeply profound .
And maybe a little bit of a look at what could happen , which is decades decades , as a cyboard of cyboard for exploration or any other purpose , in many kinds of purpose , which I can imagine as to the afford as a fiction .
Bush , these expeditions have done , and really , start to value what there is going down there , like the deep ocean , like the deep ocean resource that we &apos;re wonderful barret for the wonder .
And they &apos;re just practical beings just here on Earth .
They live in a environment of chemosynthesea .
They don &apos;t live in a sunlight based as we do .
And so you see animals that live next to 500 degrees of Celcius head .
And you might think they could be impossible .
I was also going to remember very interested in space science , again , again , the fiction of fiction is influence as a child .
And I became involved in the space of sheep , very involved at NASA , for near the NASA &apos;s deavesthesions , I went to Russions , I went to Russions , I went to the pre-cular protocools and all that sort of dinner , to the international space station to the international space station with our 3D camera on our 3D camertestation .
And this was fascinating .
But what the final result is washing , which I think I think of the scientists with our munam to the depth .
And they empowered for astrophic , planetary science , planetary science , people who were interested in those extreme environmental environmental , they &apos;re going to look at the sources , and they take samples and take samples , and so on .
Dush , there were a documentary films of the documentary as well as the documentary as well as the documental of science .
I had the circle of the argument , you know wealthy , as a child and all of this .
And I learned this journey of discovery , I learned a high .
I learned a lot about scientific . But I learned a lot about leadership .
Now , you should think that a director should be a leader leader , a leader from the ship and that kind of business .
I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership to the expeditions .
I mean , I think of a view of a view of the meaning of this ?
Why am I doing so ? What I want to do I think of it .
We don &apos;t deserve money with this disappeared programming .
They &apos;re naugmentation . It &apos;s not to be a full of existence .
People think that I &apos;ve gone to be gone by Titanickly , and I &apos;m going to realize that I &apos;m going to turn around , somewhere on the beach .
I made all of these filmmassive , all of these documentary documentary .
No famous , no glory , no glory . Where are you doing it ?
You do it for the work for self-challenging , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that there , for the exciting of the exciting , and for those strange band that exist as a small group of people a team .
Now , for all of these things that have been doing for 12 people for years .
Sometimes at the sea for 2-3 massive .
And by that band-, you realize that the most important thing is that you have for them and say , for you have a task , that you can &apos;t explain a task , which you can &apos;t explain to somebody .
When you get back to wake , and you know , we had to do this , and we had to do this and the fiber fiber , and the date , and the date , all the massive of the massive of the works of the works on sea , that you can &apos;t explain . It is that what police the thing poligives or people in the agent . It &apos;s that possibility , and they know that they can never know it .
That &apos;s a band-a-meets of respectable .
So when I came back to measure , which is what Avatory of Avatory , I was trying to do the same principle of leadership , which is that you respecting your team of respecting your team .
And that really changed the dynamics .
Dush , there I was a small teams of a tiny teams , I wasn &apos;t even more extended to the meal , new technology that hasn &apos;t existed before .
Enorm exciting .
Enorm challenge .
And we have a family , for four and a half announcement .
And it turns out how I make films .
Dush , people gave comment on how to say , the ocean organisms , the ocean organisms back to the planet Pandora .
For me , it was more a fundamental way of the process of the process of the process of that .
Dush , what can we synthesizes ?
You know , what are the learned ?
Nold , I think number is a curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing that you &apos;re sitting .
Image is an imagination of the reality is a reality of a reality ,
And the respect of your team is more important than all the lecture in the world .
And there are young filmmakers who come to me and say , &quot; Gength : Getting me a little bit of advice to dozen .
And I &apos;m saying , I don &apos;t think of the present itself .
On the other people will do for your downy , you don &apos;t do the deavor for self-realization .
And take risk of risk .
NASA has this sad where they crazy crazy .
But failure has to be an option in art and discovering , because it &apos;s a sense of deep in the deep issue .
And not a major entrequires that requires has been done without risk .
You &apos;ve got to be willing to take those risk of the risks .
And that &apos;s the thought I &apos;d like you want to latent behind that in whatever you towed a option , but fear of nonetheless . Thank you .
Now , if I can tell you one big idea today , it &apos;s that it &apos;s very much more of the data that we use , is larger than the sum of the deletal .
And instead of thinking about it to identify information , I want to think about how we can use information to pull patterns and the trends that would stay invisible .
This is a typical strengineering death to age .
The tool I &apos;m using this is an experimental experimental experimental experimental .
It &apos;s called Pivoted Pivoted , I can filter on one of the death , for instance .
I see immediately a different pattern .
That &apos;s because here in the middle people are the most actively in the middle .
We can remember outside and the data reorganizing the data and reorganizing the data .
We see that heart disease and cancer the usual challenge , but not for every single one .
And when we &apos;re going to be , for example , when we &apos;re going to see , for example , or young , we see that indicularly the largest cases of care .
If you dive down there , you know , that for male for male .
You can see what I mean is looking at information this way of seeing information in a living information .
If we can do this with rough , why don &apos;t we do this with content ?
What we greeted here is the front page of every single number of Spports Ilustrated that ever made .
Everything state . It &apos;s all about this .
You can go to your room and try this after my talks .
With Pific , you can get on a decade .
You can get on a meaning for a year .
You can go to a song number song .
I &apos;m looking at this damn . I see the athletes that are different in this number , the sports .
I &apos;m fan from Lance of mstrongly , so I &apos;m going to address , and that gives me all the numbers of Lance .
And if I just want to look at this thing , I think , why don &apos;t you know , I think , &quot; Why not all the realm of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of examples .
I do a step back and go on that .
Now I see Greg Greg Lemond .
You can see that if you laughter in this way through information , teller and broad , and then you don &apos;t leave , you don &apos;t leave anything .
You do something else that a little different issue .
It &apos;s there , and we think it changes how you can use information .
So I want to think of it a little bit , a little bit of geckery .
Here we &apos;ve taken every page of Wikipedia , and it &apos;s limited to a little covering .
The summarization is a small sync and a icology to be an icoon .
I just show you the top 500 popular Wikipedia page .
But even in this limited , we can see a lot .
We get immediately an idea of the topics that are the popular on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to check government .
Now , I &apos;ve got government , I see the Wikipedia categories that categories over there , Time magazine , Time magazine people of the Jar .
This is very important because this view in no one of the aparte Wikipedia pages satch .
You can only get it through a step backwards , and you can see them all .
And if I look at one of these consummarizations , I can look deeper on the understanding Time Persis from the year .
And a glad on all of these people learn to me that the majority of the politics .
Some people come out of natural science .
There &apos;s a smaller number of business comes from business .
is my business .
One is coming from the music global .
What &apos;s interesting isn &apos;t a TED Prize-winner .
So , we can realize for all TED Prize .
So , we navigate for the first time by the web as if it &apos;s really a web , not from page to page , but it &apos;s a higher abstrategy .
I want to show you one other thing to show you is that you may be amazing .
I &apos;m going to show you the website of the New empathy .
Pivot, this application -- I don &apos;t want to be a browser , it &apos;s not a browser , but you can see there &apos;s a web page of violin -- we bring these size technology to every web page , so on .
I &apos;m going to take a step back and return , right in a specific section .
And the reason this important is that I think , is that I &apos;m just looking at web pages to see my whole browse history in the meaningdom .
And I can go down and see what I &apos;ve been doing for the rest of what I &apos;ve been doing for the period .
Here &apos;s the status of the demo that I &apos;ve just figured out .
And I can play some of the things that I can play earlier today .
If I put a step back and look everything , I can look at my histories , I could sell my historic selling .
So here I did some nepotist research , and I was looking for Labs .
From there , I can go deeper on the page and it again .
It &apos;s one metaphor that &apos;s re-metaphor , it makes it very larger than the sum of the parts of the data .
By in our global world , we see data as a liquid .
We &apos;re talking about the fluke of the realm of information .
We &apos;re talking about drowning .
Now , if we could take that on his head , and the Web at its head , so that rather than to go from one thing to the next ones to the next ones that we can required from many things to many things to many things , and see the patterns that could see the patterns that might be hidden themselves .
And if we don &apos;t stuck that art , we &apos;re not going to be able to get information .
Instead of just working with information , we might know it knowledge .
If we &apos;re knowing , maybe even wisdom to find wisdom .
So , thank you very much .
Everybody speaks today about happiness .
I tend somebody to count the number of books that the youngest five years on the text of the title , and he has given up in about 40s , and there were a lot more .
There &apos;s lots of lots of lucky in research .
There &apos;s a lot of happiness .
Everybody wants to make people happier .
But despite that mass realizes that masses are different cognitive values that make it impossible to think about justice .
And I &apos;m going to talk about today about that cognitive values today .
This is true for ordinary people who took about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for researchers , because it turns out that we &apos;re just as in the war as the other one .
The first value is the squarters is the single of complexity .
It turns out that the word happiness is not a useful word is because we it on too many things .
And I think there &apos;s one of the meaning that we might be able to construggling it , but everything is considered to be something that we &apos;re going to have to give up the more complicated vision of what .
The deaths is the confusion between experience and memory : that comes down in the difference between your life and your lifetime and happy are about your life or your lifetime or happy with your life .
And that &apos;s two totally different things that are being thrown in one hope in the concept for sound .
And the third values is the illusion of focus and the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a circumstances that impact has impact on our wellent without the importance .
I mean , this is really a cognitive values .
It &apos;s not a way to get this good .
And I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who was a while for a problem and answered by one of my meaning a story .
And this was nice .
And he said he had listen to a symphony , and that it was absolutely fantastic music , and at the end of the extremely extremely sure such a powerful sound .
And then , really motival engineering , really motivated the whole experience .
But that climbing .
It had the reminds to the experience of the experience .
He had the experience .
He had 20 minutes fantastic music .
And they were nothing more worthy because he was a remembering ; the remember was department , and the remembering was already what he had loved .
And what this is what this brings us is that we could see ourselves and others as two of them .
There &apos;s an experiencing , which is living in the presents and knowledge , which is able to reinforced the past the past the past .
And the doctor focused to our experience -- if the doctor asking , if the doctor asks the pain as I &apos;m touching you here to touch for me .
And then there &apos;s the remindset , and the remind I is the one that &apos;s biting the state and the story of our lives , and that &apos;s the story of our lives , and that &apos;s the deaths the deavor of the realization of the aware of the realm of the realm of the wish of the wildlife .
or a sense of the journey of the journey , or sweet .
And that &apos;s two very different dinner , I experiencing and remembering and the confusion between them is both part of the cooky that &apos;s made of happiness .
It I remember is a telling .
And that really begins with a fundamental response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
We &apos;re not only telling stories when we make us to tell stories .
Our memmemory is tells us that wants to say , which is what we can exist of our experiences is a story .
And let me show with one example .
This is an old research .
Those are real meaning .
I spent you the detail . This is not painful today , but it was painful at this time , but it was painful when this research for 90s .
They had to rest every 60 seconds about their pain report .
And these are two means .
These are their addict .
And it gets to be asked by the purpose of them .
And that &apos;s a very easy problem .
It &apos;s obviously that allows has pulled more .
His colonoscopy has longer sustainable , and for every minute pain that &apos;s A has had been having a memory and messages .
But here &apos;s another questions : How many pain thinking that they &apos;ve taken this aware of welling ?
And what a surprise : The surprise is that the resource is a much worse for a bad rememory of the Cology &apos;s messages of Br.
The stories of the colonoscopies differently , because a very important part of the story is a very important part of the waste -- and no of these stories is extremely extremely or choice -- but one of them is just one of them .
And the ergal story is the pain the end .
That &apos;s a quality .
How do we know ? How do we know that ? Because these people asked their colonoscopy early , and a lot of teacher , and a lot of teacher .
and it was much worse for A than for B, in their memories .
Well , this is a justice of conflict between the experience and the remind .
From the point of view of the experiencing I &apos;ve got the clear public .
Well , what you could do with the meaning of A, and we really have clinical produce challenge , and that &apos;s going to happen the collaborator of the colonoscopy of employed by allogist in the business , just a lot of it .
That causes the empathy of suffering , but not field , and much less than before .
And if you have that a few minutes , you have the experiencing I think of the well-A , and you &apos;ve got it to remember , and you have it to remember a lot better story about his experience .
What &apos;s a story ?
And that &apos;s true for the stories that are supposed to the memory us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we collect .
What a story of the meaning is changing important moments and end .
Einds are the universe , very important and in this case was the end .
Well , the experiencing I live his life .
It &apos;s got moments of experiencing , one after the other .
And you know , what happens to this moment ?
And the answer is really simple .
They &apos;re always length for all .
I mean , I mean , the present moments of our lives -- I have the extremely -- is the psychological psychological takes about three minute says about three minutes .
That meaning , you know , in a life , you have about 600 million .
In a month , there are about 60,000,000,000,0000,000,000,000,0000,0000,000,000,0000,00000,000,000,000,00,000,00,00,00,00,000,000,000,0000,00,00,0
It doesn &apos;t make any traces .
At the present is not spent attention by remember .
And you know , in one way or other way the impression that they should be from the telling these experiencing moments our lives .
It &apos;s the end commodity that we use for employee .
And how you relevant to be relevant , but so that the story is not that the remembering for us .
So we remember it , and the experiencing I and that are really different except .
The biggest difference between both lies in the major ,
From the point of view of the experiencing I have a vacation , and it &apos;s a very good thing as the first than two weeks as well as the vacation of one week .
It doesn &apos;t work for remember .
For the memorizing I is a vacation of two weeks better than the vacation of one week because there &apos;s no new memories are added .
You don &apos;t have the story .
And in that way , in that way , is actually the challenges a remember I distinct from an experiencing .
Time has very few impact on this .
I remembering more than remembering and stories .
It &apos;s the except that decisions takes dealt , if you &apos;ve got disease , say , two colonologies , say , two colonologies and have had to decide which he &apos;s going to choose any of the least remember , and that is the surgeon .
The experiencing I don &apos;t have voice in this kitchen .
We don &apos;t choose between experience .
We choose between memories of experiencing . And even if we don &apos;t think about the memories we don &apos;t normally think about our memories as an experience .
We think of our extremely as a member of our member .
And you can actually look at this as a dictatory , as a dictature of the memory , and you can remember it the experiences that I did not remember the experiences that I don &apos;t need it experiences that the powerful thing I don &apos;t need the sense , I feel that if we &apos;re going to go with vaction the most of the largely , the major to the large part of our remember .
And that &apos;s pretty hard to think responsible .
I mean , how often use our member ingene ?
That &apos;s one of the explanations that is given for the dominance of remember .
And when I think about that I think about a vacation that we had a couple of years ago in Antarctica , which is obviously our best vacation ever washing , and I think of rather often in comparing with other vaccement .
And I have a memories of my rememories for three weeks for about 25 minutes , the last four yarency .
Nuth , if I had opened the map of the 600 photographs of it , I would have an hour .
So that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s almost anti-and-a-half .
There &apos;s an argument .
Numory , maybe I &apos;m a little extremely known , in the limited hunger that I have to rememories , but even if you &apos;re a familiar with the hammation : why are we going to remembering so much more interestingly to rememories in the interest with the importance that we &apos;re going to experiencing across the interest with the importance that we &apos;re going to be so much about experiencing acknowledge .
So I want you to think about a thought experimental experimentation .
Now , imagine you know , if you know , at the end of the vacation of the vacation is going to be destroyed , and you get a pill that you knew memory of memory so you don &apos;t rememory anything more .
Would you choose a vacation ? And if you choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between you .
and you have to think about how you conflict conflict .
And that &apos;s not as for granted , because if you think of time in terms of time you get a single answers .
And if you think in terms of memories , you may have another answers .
Why we choose the vactions that we choose confront of our confront of choice .
Number two leading to two notes of happiness .
There are really two forms of happiness that we can applications , one .
So , you can suggest how happy is the experiencing ?
And then , would you know , how happy are the moments in life of the experiencing ?
And they &apos;re all -- the happiness of moments is a rather complicated processes .
So , what are the metables that can be community ?
Brens, today we are able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of experiencing the time .
If you ask the happiness of the member I is that a total other seed .
This is not about how happy somebody lived .
It &apos;s about how happen or following the meaning of having its life .
Total different conceptable .
Everybody who these concepts in one hope will make a coot of the study of the lucky , and I mean , for a group of the exactly for a long time of the study of the happiness of the study of the happiness of the study of the study of the happiness of the study of the happiness of the happiness of the study of the happiness of the happiness , and I think of the happiness to a group of the study of the happiness of the happiness .
The distinction between the happiness of experiencing and the suffering of the remember , and there are attempts to realize the two separate separate , the Gallup Organization is a global for more than a million people have been asking about what they think about their lives and their experiencing .
And there &apos;s more efforts in that sense .
So the young years , we &apos;re starting to produce the happiness of the two .
And the main lesson that we &apos;ve gone is that it &apos;s really different from each other .
You can know how to do somebody with his life is , and that &apos;s really very little about how happy he teaching his life .
Just to give you an idea of the correlation , the correlation is about 0,500 .
That means that if you ought to meet somebody , you would say his father a tasy of issue , how much would you know about his length ?
You would know something about his length , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
You know , a lot of uncertainty , if I tell you that somebody his life is eight on a scale of uncertainty , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are about their experiencing .
So the correlationship is weaky .
We know something about what the practices of the experiencing I &apos;m telling .
We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
We know that happiness means that happiness means that we have been touching with people we mogene .
There are other pleasures , but this weights .
So , if you &apos;re lucky to maximize the two , it will turn out that you have very different things .
The conclusion of what I said here is that we really wouldn &apos;t considered as a substitute for well-being .
It &apos;s a very different conceptable conceptable .
And then very , very , very , a different reason why we don &apos;t think about happiness is that we can &apos;t think about the meaning , and if we &apos;re effectively about life .
So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people in California , you won &apos;t get the right answer .
If you ask that question , you think people have to be happier in California , if you &apos;re going to have to go into California .
And what happens when you think about life in California , you think about the contrast between California and other places , and that contrast is in the climate .
It turns out that the climate doesn &apos;t matter so important for the experiencing I , and not even the thinking about how happy people .
But because it &apos;s the way I think of the boss it can turn out that you -- that somehow move to California .
And it &apos;s kind of interesting to go to what &apos;s going to happen to people who moved to California lot of happier .
Well , their experiencing themselves will not happier .
That knows .
But one thing happens . They think they &apos;ll be lucky , because if they think about it will be reminded to remember how terrible it was reminded how terrible it was in Ohio .
And they &apos;ll think that they &apos;re going to have the right decision .
It &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and I hope I &apos;ve given you a sense of how fashion .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for youth .
Very much .
When we were in a couple of weeks ago , you told me that there was a very interesting finding me that there was a very interesting finding Galling .
Can you have this with us a few minutes about a few minutes ?
Daniel Kahneman: Sure I think the most interesting result in the Galling pollution is a number we didn &apos;t have absolutely expected .
It has to do with the happiness of experiencing .
And if we look at how feelings we look at the income .
It turns out that under the revenues of 60,000 dollars a year for Americans , and then it &apos;s all over a whole big group of Americans , and so 60,000,000,0000,000 dollars per year ...
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars per year than people are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting more unhappy , and they become more unhappier .
And we see a full-flat lighter .
I mean , I got rarely self-flat lights .
It &apos;s obvious , what happens is that money you don &apos;t bring a lack of money , but that &apos;s a lack of money , and we can measuring those miserable measure with case , very large precise .
For the other ikness , you remember a very different thing .
And the more money you &apos;re going to get the more following you .
That &apos;s not true for the present .
CA : But Danny, the entire American streads of life , and the pursuit of happiness .
If people who come up with the results severe than that I think of being touched by the meaning that we believe , say , well , such policy policy , such policy policy and so .
an opportunity that the country would take the general result in a such result , and the public public public public public public public public .
DKeat the present , I think there &apos;s recognition of the role of happiness in public policy .
That recognition is going to be slow in the United States , which is not doubt , but in the U.K. in the U.K. is this to happen in other countries .
People it should be thinking about happiness when they think about public policy .
It &apos;s going to take a time and people will debate about whether they want to debate happiness or the evaluation of life , so we &apos;re going to have to study some of life .
How we &apos;re lucky lucky depending on how you think and whether you think about the memoriginally I or the experiencing .
This is going to influenced the policies in the next year , I think .
In the United States , in the United States are exciting happiness of population .
I think that &apos;s going to talk about a year or 20 of the national statistics .
CA: Wel, the exciting thing that this subject is the most interesting policy policy problem for the next few years or should be to follow for the next few years .
Thank you so much for your invention of the havioral economics .
Thank you . Danny Kahneands .
I &apos;m going to talk to you today about energy and climate .
And perhaps a little bit of surprimary , because my wellular time is about variety and business , about the things that we need to recognize and for the poorest two of the poorest of people .
But energy and climate are extremely important for this human beings , in fact , more importantly than simply for this planetary .
It &apos;s climate to the crops so that their crops will not grow growing .
There will be too many rain , or too , too ,
Things will change their vulnerable , so that their vulnerable environmental ,
And that leads to hungry . It leads to uncertainty . It leads to uncertainty .
So the climate change will be a disaster for them .
The price of energy is extremely important for hengage .
And in fact , if you could choose one thing to do is , to reduce the poverty of poverty .
The energy price is silent to the dalene .
Every , very advanced civilization is based on the front of energy .
The steen-carbon revolution lead to the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a very deaths for electricity , and therefore , we have the revolution , air conditional conditional , we can make move modern messages and so many things .
And so we have a wonderful situation with electricity in the world .
Now , we make the cheap -- and let &apos;s make it twice as cheap -- and let &apos;s make it twice as cheap -- there &apos;s a new limitation , and it has to do with CO2 .
CO2 leads to heat from the planets , and the equation of CO2 is actually a very extremely .
And when you tells the CO2 that gets out , which leads to a temperature , which leads to a temperature , and that temperature leads to some very negative effects .
The effects of the again , perhaps more , the effects effects , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to this , and so you get ecosystems that collapse .
Number exactly amount of how to make sure from CO2 to what temperature is going to go to what temperature is going to go , and where the positive back , is about that is the only uncertainty , but not very field .
And there is no extremely about how much the consequences will be , but they will be very serious .
I often asked this to top-science .
we really need to get out of nability ?
Can &apos;t we have half or a quarter ?
And the answer is , until we &apos;re going to keep in the neighborhood , the temperature will stay .
And so that &apos;s a big challenging .
It &apos;s very different from , for example , a very high-truck firm trucks under a 3.6 , which is trying to get out of it .
This is something that is to zero .
Number a lot of CO2 , more than 26 examples .
For every American , this is about 20 .
For people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one .
It &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
And we encourage , how to change things to zero .
It &apos;s constantly constantly up .
It &apos;s just a little economic changes , so we need to have a dectory of an incredibly measures to zero-sum measured to zeroo .
This equation has four facility .
A little bit collection .
CO2 , you have something about the left officer , CO2 , which is based on the left , and that &apos;s based on the number of human , the average use of services per personal services per personal , the average of energy for every service , and the CO2 , and the CO2 ,
Bush , let &apos;s look at this piece for piece and see how we can get this to zero .
Probably one of these values in the neighborhood of zero come .
That &apos;s high school mathematics , but let &apos;s take a look at .
First of all , we have the population .
Number the world today has 6.8 eight in mental today .
And that &apos;s at the rise to about names of the argument .
Duses , if we do it really well with new various health care , healthcare , reproductive health productive healthcare , then we could reduce that metable , missions we can see a little bit of about 1,300 .
The extraordinary is the services that we use .
And this remaintainly , the amazing thing we &apos;re clothes , clothes , heat , heat .
These are very good dinnership , and it away from poverty means to almost everybody on the planet .
So it &apos;s wonderful as this number ,
In the world , perhaps the summit of the world , we can sutences , and the except I suppose , but this is going to be a number , on average , the supply , the employed services at a lot more than double .
Here we have a very extremely service .
Have your lighting into your lighting your lighting your lights , the fact , these children go outside and reading their homework .
Bush , efficient , E, the energy for every services .
We &apos;ve eventually we have good news .
We have something that we don &apos;t rise .
Those invention and new invention of religent , through other kinds of automobile , other excells of construction .
There are a lot of services where you can reduce the energy that &apos;s wildlife .
Some of the service of the service , even with 90 prostate .
There are other services , as how we produce measures or how we produce with air airs , where we have a lot of smaller .
And dusingle , if we numbers , we can have a factor three to self-circular factor .
But for these first three factors , we &apos;ve gone of 26 empathy , and that &apos;s just not pleasant .
So , let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a paling -- and that &apos;s the CO2 empathy equivalent .
So the question , can you get that to zero ?
If you stop coal , needle .
You know , you know , you know , needge .
All right , we have today is electricity producer today , except for the emerging expensive energy and nuclear energy , CO2 .
And so what we need to do is a new system of global scale .
So we &apos;ve invited wonderful wonder .
Duses , if I used the term , I &apos;m not going to go to something that impossible .
The processor is a mirroprocessor is a wonder .
The Internet and his services are a wonderful .
Duses , the people have contributed here to the present of wonder .
And Normaliter we don &apos;t have deadlinear , when you have to employed it .
Most of you just wait out , and sometimes it happens , sometimes .
This is a case where we actually have to fully on the full of the meaningdom and have to get within a punishment .
Now , how could I do this , how can I do this ?
It &apos;s a kind of natural illustrategy , a demonstration that humans to the imagination ?
I was thinking about a year ago when I spent a mosquitoes and I found it in some way .
It actually made it involved in the idea that there are people who are lifetime with mosquitos .
Bus, with energy , this was the only thing I could do .
And I decided to flies free as my contribution to the environment here .
So here we have some natural fireflight here .
And they &apos;re told that they don &apos;t even more , more perhaps , they may not even leave this potential .
Dush , there are all kinds of gimmunders like dieval , but they don &apos;t really do something .
We have invitable to invitable , in an incredible scale and of an incredible scale and of an incredible contraction , although people in many directions , I see there are actually the empathy contribution .
And so , I &apos;ll leave at some time , geothermal energymic , biofuel , biofuels .
It may be able to wear something , and if they do better than I expect , is that the most important thing , but my main point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five and we don &apos;t get to sit , because there &apos;s so immediately , because they all have their own important .
Let &apos;s do first look at fossil fuels , either burn for fossil fuels .
What you have to do is to be a deaths of it , but that &apos;s none .
You &apos;ve got to take all the CO2 after the burning burning , under pressure , more liquid , liquid , liquid and hope that it makes it continued there .
Now there &apos;s a number of profits that level of 60 to 80 percent door , but it &apos;s going to be 00-percent door , but it &apos;s going to be a lot of tough and determine where we have to stop all that CO2 is also very hard , but the long-term problem .
Who &apos;s going to this for science ?
Who will be there for a garant for something that literally exist of the argumen is bigger than any species of nuclear or other dinner ?
This is a huge volume .
So that &apos;s a difficult .
The next is nuclear energy .
Even this big problems .
The cost of the regulately landscene , are high .
The issue of security , really , really , that nothing can wrong , in fact , nothing is wrong , although you have this existence that the split can &apos;t be used for nuclear weapons .
And what do you do with the waste ?
Even though it &apos;s not so much , there are a lot of issues .
There must be a good feeling about it .
So three very difficult problems that perhaps exactly , and that must be employment .
The last three of the fifth , I &apos;ve been peddal for the last three .
These are some people often the renewable resources .
And that -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t require a fuel distance .
One is that the density of the energy won through these technologies through these technologies are lower than that of an electricity scentral .
This is energieland-building , you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of miles , more than you need for a normality .
Also , these are intermitting burn .
The sun &apos;t seeing the entire lady , and not every day , and no white it &apos;s not white it .
And dune , if you &apos;re dependent from this fire , you also have to find a way to have energy to have the time that they &apos;re not available to be available .
Bush we have big cost challenges .
We have transportation challenge .
For instance , that these energy source outside your country , you have not just the technology invited , but you &apos;ve got to do with the risk of the energy of thirds .
So , finally , it collected problem .
And to make that visible , I &apos;ve looked at all the species of batteries that made out of batteries , for authority , for pocem , for business , for business , and compared that the amount of the amount of power that the world , and what I found is that all the batteries we make less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
So we have a big breakthrough here , something that is a factor of a factor here is better than the approach we now .
It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
This is important when you &apos;re trying to get reliable source higher than 20 to 30 percent of what you used to use .
If you have 00-miracle , you &apos;ve invited a wonderful battery .
Number how are we going to go on , what &apos;s the right ?
It &apos;s a Manhattan-to-to-meeting ? How can we know this employee ?
Nouth , we need a lot of companies that are about it .
In every single of them , at least hundred human beings .
And a lot of henching , you &apos;ll find . That &apos;s cheap .
And I think that in the TED group , we have a lot of people who have this already pursuit .
Bill Gaware of various company called eSolar who &apos;s Solar that big thermal solar technologies .
From Khosla investing in tens of companies are doing great things and interesting and I try to support that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I supporting a company , perhaps nuclear power .
There are a number of innovations in nuclear energy , moduce , and fluid .
And there &apos;s been no regulatory for a long time , so it &apos;s not so strange that there &apos;s good new good for .
The idea of Terra is date date , instead of a tinstead of a tiny oranium , one procently U-235 , which we ended to use the 999percent of U-2380-.
A little bit strange ideas .
Men has ever been talking about thought , but they were able to be able to do good for whether it would work .
But by the way of the supercomputers can now , and hunt !
With the right thing .
And because you use the 999percent , reduce the cost enormous .
You know , you even waste it , and as a fuel , you can see all the reactors of current reactors .
So , instead of concerned that new fuel , that &apos;s amazing !
And it &apos;s a regularly the reaction . It &apos;s a map of a map .
And you can see in this animation , often the process of the realization is called an actor .
For the fuel , this is really , this is a really dealse .
I have a picture of a place in Kentucycle .
This is nuclear waste , the 99 , where the 1percent of the published .
So it &apos;s called uranium .
That &apos;s enough for the United States for hundreds of years .
And by the way , you get to filtering seawater , you get enough fuel for fuel for the entire planetary of the whole planetary .
Duser , there are a lot of challenges for the future , but it &apos;s an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of them .
So let &apos;s say , how do we measure ?
How to report our report of view ?
Let &apos;s first look where we need to emerge , and then to the tusensory away .
For 2050s , speaking a lot of people about 80-percent reduction .
And that it &apos;s really important to do that .
And that 20 percent is going to be through poor agriculture .
Hopefully we have clean and cementation .
Bush , to pull that 80s must be the developed language , including countries like China , their electricity produce .
And the other injuries : Passistant technology in all the developed language , and we &apos;re going to introduce that elsewhere ?
That &apos;s super important .
That &apos;s a important measuring point for that report .
Duses , how to report it for 2020 ?
Nouth , it has to those two issues .
We have to improvements that efficiency improvements .
And the less we putting , the lower the CO2 wordwide , the lower the temperature .
But in some sense , the degree of doing things that we have , by doing things that are not to produce the majority , or perhaps even less than the other thing , that is the piece of involution .
And these breakthroughout the measure , and we can measure that measure in terms of businesses , regular excellent things that are changed .
Here &apos;s a large number of books about saving .
The realization of Al Goreorigin Century , and the David McKay , for David of David McKenergy .
They &apos;re really going to take it right and imagine a framework that can be practice in large lines , because we have to have a wide running flat here .
There &apos;s a lot that together .
So this is a wishing .
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we inventing this technology .
If you gave me one wish for the next 50 years , I could choose the president , I could choose a president , I could choose a wish of wood , or I could choose something that &apos;s been invented with half the cost , without CO2 , this is the wish I would choose any CO2 , this is the wish I was going to every whose the whose .
This is the one with the biggest impact .
If we don &apos;t get this wish , the separation between the people who think about short term and run on a long term , between the United States and China , between the United States and Chinain between poor and Chinain between the United States and Chinatian and rich the lives of the lives that two .
Dush , what should we do ?
So , what I &apos;m going to ask you ?
We need to do more finance of research .
If countries come together in places like Copenhagen , they don &apos;t have to just the CO2 .
They need to be able to speak this indicularly , and you &apos;ll be suspending of the ridiculous spreading to this ingenuinely existence .
We &apos;ve been invitable , CO2 tax promise , putting and handle , something that the cost visible .
We need to wear the message .
This dialogue needs to rational and understanding of the steps that the government .
This is a major transition , but I think we can know it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you . Now , I understand more about Terrapology -- I mean , I meant , the first place , can you give an idea of the investment of the investment ?
Bill Gates: All the software , the supercomputer , the supercomputer , all the big scientists , all the big scientists , which is the equal of millions of millions , and even though we have a time for the members of the reactor to be that our balance is going to be the high in the hundreds of millions .
The tricky becoming the building of the experimental reacts , finding the regulatory of the regulatory , the site of the regulatory .
You have the first built , if you &apos;ve built the first , as this works like , it &apos;s just overclear , because the economy , the energy , the energy density , the energy density , as different nuclear energy as we have that knowledge .
CA: And jail to understand it good , it &apos;s going to be building deep under the ground almost as a kind of vertical column of nuclear fuel to uranium , and then it starts to uranium , and then the process of the process , and then the process of the bottom , then it &apos;s going on the top of the bottom and then during it down ?
BG: That &apos;s right . Today , the reactor has to be converted , so you &apos;ve got to have a lot of people and a lot of the controls who can wrong in the control that you have to open up and out of it .
That &apos;s not good .
Duses , if you have a very cheap resource that you can see 60 years -- you know , you know , it &apos;s like a background process -- and it &apos;s not a burden of that complexity .
And it &apos;s just a firest , and it &apos;s a challenge , and then the thoughands of them .
CA: It &apos;s a nuclear realization problem .
BG: Ja. Nouth , what happens to the waste , you can sit down -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this approach -- or you can actually realize it in a different and put it in a different and burn it .
And we &apos;re beginning to make the waste today , which is in the reactor of the reactor , or is stored in the reactor .
That &apos;s our fuel to initially initially .
Dush , what was a problem from this reactors is actually what &apos;s going to be introduced in the unsea , and you reduce the volume of the deliberately dramatic by processes .
CA: But in your global conversations about these possibility , where is really interested in this possibly ?
BG: Nouth , we don &apos;t have been extremely extraordinarily interesting rules about everything that nuclear is nuclear homes , so we &apos;re going to enjoy a lot of nuclear humans , that people from the business of the business of the business of the business of the business of the business of the business of all , so we &apos;re not .
I &apos;ve met the state secretaris of energy about this , to be a retaris about how this is the energy agendly energal .
So I &apos;m optimize . You know that the empathy and the Japanese , the Japanese .
This is a variant on something that &apos;s done .
It &apos;s a major step forward , but it &apos;s as a process of reactor , and many countries have been done , so everyone who &apos;s been doing a potential candidate , is a potential candidate to build the first .
CA: Dus, in your minds , in your minds , and probability of something like this on the reality ?
BG: Nou, we &apos;ve got these electricity for these electricity things that we need to think very cheap things very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to think and then 20 years to implement .
That &apos;s a kind of term that the environmental models that we have to suffering .
En, knows , Terrapology , as well , what a lot of people &apos;s going to do that easy .
And there are now lucky business , we &apos;ve invited hundreds of indiempathy , long-research and their research as well , as the financision for their prosthetic installations , that they can compete with this .
And it &apos;s the best thing to do is , because then you can use a mix of this dingene .
We need at least one to bet .
CA: In terms of possible changes in largest scal, this is the biggest that you know ?
BG: A energy breakthrough is the very important voice .
That would be it &apos;s not even the environmental limitation , but it makes the environmental it makes so much large .
In the nuclear sector are also other innovators .
You know , you know , the meaning of their work as well as the fashion , but the modue , that &apos;s a different approach .
There &apos;s a type of liquid reacts that a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
So there are different de, but the beauty of this is a uranium moleculation has a million times as much energy as a bvice moleculation , and such as you can deal with the negative effects in terms of the negative effects in terms of the footprint and the cost , in terms of effect on the country and the cost , in terms of effect on the country , in terms of effect on the land and different dinner .
CA : If this doesn &apos;t work ?
Do we &apos;re starting with the regular measuregulate to try to figure out the temperature of the Earth ?
BG: If you &apos;re in those situation , the as if you competition , and at the point is to get a heart .
Where are you going to get a heart operation or something like that .
There &apos;s a line of research that &apos;s extraordinary exploration , that are different techniques that would slow down the heat that we would reduce 20 or 30 years to be extremely given the wildlife .
That &apos;s just a kind of distance .
You don &apos;t require that .
Some people say , you don &apos;t even have to work on sweek , because it perhaps you know , you &apos;re going to keep on food because you know there &apos;s a heart operation to be a heart operation .
I don &apos;t know if that distance , the importance of the importance of problem , but there &apos;s now the except for the invational except that in the back of the case for the case , or as the invational process of the involution is going to slow amount .
CA: Klimate sculpture , if you could , two sentences to them , how would you convincing them that they error from sitting them wrong sitting them salt ?
BG: Nou, unfortunately the skeptics .
There are very little with scientific argument .
Does that there are negative feedback effects that have to do with the clouds that compensent things ?
There are very little things that they can still be able to do it in a million that they can still be opportunity .
The main problem we have is just like an AIDS .
You get the mistake , and you pay a lot more later .
And then , when you drinking all kinds of issue , the idea is now taking the pain to get later the benefit -- and a scarchain .
In fact , the IPCC report , not necessarily , the worst scenario, and there are people in the rich world that are going from the IPCC and sagentlement , that falls all rather .
It should be that uncertainty that uncertainty of us that .
But my dream is date , if you can calculate the economic , and then following the CO2 , then the skeptics of the skeptics that there is no CO2 from the next , I would even wish that there was no CO2 from coming out , but I might even wish it because it &apos;s cheasy .
CA: And that would be your reaction on the argument of Bjorn Lomborg, which is that if you spend all of this energy to the express of the CO2 , which is going to try to resolve the world of poverty and malaria , etc .
It &apos;s a dumb waste of aid resources to spend money there , if there are better things that we can do with it .
BG: Nouth , the actual spending for that Ready , the United States , say that the United States should be spent more than now -- is not so dramatic .
It doesn &apos;t have to be having to other dinner .
It &apos;s really just in big amount of big amount of opinion that , when you have something that uneconomic , when you try something that uneconomic , trying to figure out .
That issues , usually , most of a waste .
And unless you &apos;re very close to you &apos;re very close to you , and you only the teachers , and it becomes very cheap .
And I think we need to try to get more things that potential to be much less expensive .
So , if it &apos;s going to get you to start , let the energy support you can get the energy super expensive , it can afford .
I mean , all of us here might be five times as much for our energy to pay without having changing our lifestyle .
The disaster is for that two ardless .
And even Lomborg has changed .
His credo is a zero , why isn &apos;t spot more about Re D .
He &apos;s going to be steady , because of his empowered , associated with the skeptical campaign , but he realized that a pretty champs , and he &apos;s now the Ree for the Reseveral progress .
And so there &apos;s a red wire that I think I &apos;m interested in .
It &apos;s crazy about how little the Re Real-function .
CA: Well , Bill, I suspect I was from the name of the member when I say , I really hope that your wish for your wish in fulfilling . Thank you very much .
BG: Thank you .
Now , you know , what I discovered a couple of mass when I wrote an article for the italian Wirescue .
I love the theaurus always hands in the hand if I look at the text , but I was finishing the word of the piece , and I thought I &apos;d never been the word of the word of invalization .
I read you the text .
Now , invalization , nute , supplies , reveal , relieves , ute , failure , reduction , reduced mallowed , public , disappeared , acquipment , acquipment , provided explain , public , disabled , disabled , disabled , disabled , dance , disabled , danquestions , decute , drowed , dry .
Antonious : healthy , capable of healthy .
I read this to a friend , and I read for a friend , because it &apos;s so ridiculously washing for male , but flattached to break up to myself because of the malley to myself because of the choice and the choice that shake these words .
Good , this is a multiple of parthesis .
I don &apos;t think this is an old printing , this is an old printing .
But it was a pressure from the early &apos; 80s , when I started about the lower school and a picture of myself out of myself except for family , and related to the other children and the world to the world .
I don &apos;t have to say that when goddden no teacher .
With this environmental resources that I was born in a world for somebody when I was considered to say anything positial about , I worked in my life for the opportunities and adventage that I &apos;ve been in my life .
So I was going to look for the 2009 , online editional , and expected a fine rescue .
This is the conversion of the text .
Unfortunately .
I think , especially , the last words of Dight-mental mental extend to be extract equisiational meaningdom .
It &apos;s not just about today .
It &apos;s about our opinion people as we flowed them with these vices .
The values behind the words , and how we construct those values .
Our language influences , and how we see the world and how we look at other people .
A lot of old societies include the Greeks and the Romen believed that the spread of a lique as powerful washing , because if you say something hardly tells that it gets .
So , what we want to do for reality , so we want to be constraints , or a multiple of issue ?
When we do something simple , when we do something simple as the qualify of a personality , we limited them and work a shadow about their force .
Don &apos;t we far doors for them ?
Somebody who was in my doctor for me was my doctor , when I washing for A.I. Dupont Institute in Wilmon , Delawaree .
It &apos;s called Dr. Pizzutility .
Italian American , whose name was extremely hard to speaking , so he was to Dr. Please .
Dr. Ped always very smuggles and exactly colory and had exactly the good institution to children .
I mean , I mean , almost everything in the time that I think of the disease , with exception of the physiotherapy sessiotherapy .
I mean , almost countless telligible repeately with those thicks -- to different colors -- different colors -- to build my benefit .
I hatte that elastonished more than both .
I hated them . I gave them . I hatte sea .
As a five-year-year-old child , I negotiated with Dr. Preference that exercise .
And one day he came in with a session -- and he came in with a session -- and he said to member , and he said to measure . Aien , you &apos;re such an empathy girl , I &apos;m going to make such a sense of empathroughout .
And if you allow for me to cut for your hundred dollar for hundred ,
Of course , this was a tactical site of Dr. P to let me do the practice I wasn &apos;t going to do with the richest five-year-year-old girl of girl of the department , but what he actually did for me was a narrow , daily event to a currency ,
And now , I &apos;m going to ask to ask me in the correct vision and powerful girl , my self-assumption , my self-image , as an inherently , powerful and afforders of the future .
This is an example of how adults in power spositions , in power spositions ,
But in the previous situations of that thesis , our language reality that we would like to reality to the reality that we all like to see , the opportunity for the individual to the individual .
Our language is following changes in society , and many of them are evolved by technologies .
With medical engineering , my gentlement , my gentlements for worldwide , titanium , and hip focused for old bodies to deal with their opportunity to deal with their opportunity to deal with their own , to be able to described , but to sure about social networldwide , in which people can consider themselves can describing with the global networldwide , so that they can deal with the world .
So , perhaps technology is allowing us a lot of something that is always a truth : that everybody has something extraordinary and something powerful has too , and that ability to adapt us to our best property .
The ability of humans are interesting because everybody wants to continue to confront with me , and I &apos;m going to talk about to me , and I &apos;m going to do something right now .
And that sentence has never nothing to me , and it felt uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and I &apos;m going to start to get the questions of people .
The fragile extraordinary extremely that success or happiness , or happiness , means that success or happiness , no surgery , no business to have an involved , as though my successfully , as though my successfully across the pollen of life with artificial sequence , which others are consequence as my hands .
But in reality , we have changed . Of course , we &apos;ve been text by a challenge , whether it &apos;s physicist , or both of them .
And my statement is that a good thing .
Today is not an obstacle that we have to move through , but to be able to life .
It &apos;s a part of our life .
I have the tendency it as my shadow .
Sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes I see a lot , but it &apos;s always measure .
I wasn &apos;t going to impact the impact and the importance of someone &apos;s wildlife .
And there &apos;s challenge and challenge in the life , and it &apos;s all really all and for everyone else , but the question is not the question that you will have to represent , but how to replicate with it .
So , our responsibility is not simply to protect our to protect for the confront of it , but they &apos;re good at it to be good at it .
We don &apos;t prove our children if we make them feel that they &apos;re not able to fit .
There &apos;s an important difference and distinction between the objective fact that I &apos;ve been an amputed and the subjective society .
Actually brief , the only actual disability that I was continued to describe is the world that you could describe to me with that described me with that definitely describing me it .
And in our desire to protect our to protect by giving them the pound of their feet , or even a prognosis of the field of lively , we must have to be the multimate quality of life , we need to really involve someone that we really really really involved the mask of knowledge .
Maybe it makes the current way of looking at what &apos;s piece to you , and how we have to repathology it , somebody else in the pathology selfish .
It &apos;s not to go out of the reality of a personally , by their strength , not to recognize a new disease on the natural order on the natural order of the natural order that maybe .
In fact , we &apos;ve added somebody &apos;s added to our society .
So , we need to look around the pathology around the pathology of the massive .
The most important thing is that there &apos;s a collaboration between those visible text order and our best creative capability .
It &apos;s not going to default that difficult times or afford to deal with whatever we want to avoid , but instead of that opportunities in the opportunity .
Perhaps the idea that I want to shape that you don &apos;t have so much to overwinner , but you have to open for it , but you have to open up a strengaging , but you &apos;ve got to use a struggle .
If we look at that as a naturally , consistant and useful , we &apos;re going to feel less about it .
This year we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin , and when he wrote 150 years ago , I think of evolution , I think a fact that &apos;s environment .
It &apos;s pretty translated , it &apos;s not the strongest species that survival , the most intelligent , but the species that allowed the kind of change .
Conflict is the genesis of creational .
On other from Darwindows , we can make the human ability to survive and driven by the mental mental conflicts to transformation .
Again , transformation , transformation , which is our biggest capacity .
Until we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re asking about proposal .
The other thing that is the one that opposite our office : self-realizing , a sense of our own force .
So , we &apos;ve got ourselves a gift .
We can re-imagine , as a more difficult than just a middle .
Maybe we can see it as a change .
Today change is a change that we don &apos;t have an adapted yet .
And I think the most important contradiction that we have given ourselves the understanding of the majority .
Who is there than normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s habrief . There &apos;s typing . There &apos;s no normal .
And I think that &apos;s going to meet that armeans to meet as a massive ?
I thought it .
And if we can deal with the paradigm of pursue to one of the possibility , or a potential , or the potential , we can institutes a lot more kids , and they invitable to invite their rare , and they invite their rarely considerable and valently their self-domestic with the mality .
Anthropologists are telling us that the only thing we need to have people of our groups of our group of gene is useful .
There are singing that Neanderthalers 60,000 years ago , their elders , and perhaps narrative because the life experience and survival experience and survive from these people from value to the appropriate , they &apos;re not considered and useless .
A few years ago I was on the market in the village where I grew up in that red piece in nordoor Pennsylvaniade , and I stood above over a tour .
It was a summer . I had a short broke .
And I heard a guy behind me : Aimee , if Aimee Mullin
I turned around , it was an old male . It was an idea of male .
I &apos;m like , of Pardonation , I can &apos;t remember that for each other &apos;s member .
And he is , it &apos;s good possible that you don &apos;t know anymore .
When we meeting each other , I had to meeting you out of your encourage ,
Okay .
And it was the quarter of the quarter .
This man was a doctor Keaning , a guy that I just killing through my mom , because I had to leave tech for my own birthday .
So , my mother &apos;s Prock was a vacation of a vacation , so the guy who was a strange for my age .
And because I was born without clear and introduced feet , and a couple of tens to the other feeding , the bad news of the bad news .
And he said to you know , I think of member , and I think , you could never have any movement , and it would have no motivity to have other children and totally no independent life could have no independent lives at all the time of my mind .
And the extremely maintainly , he was collected by my childhood during my childhood during my childhood whether it was that I gave a game lassince in the case of Heallowon &apos;s allowed , or one of my sports , or one of my sports , and he uses it , integrated it in his sportant , and uses the integrated it for his reading for the Hah , and the Hah , and the Chestian .
Of course , he called this the x-facility , the potential of the wildlife .
No prognose can predict how powerful this can be as powerful factor for the quality of somebody &apos;s life .
Dokter Kean went away , he sea : I &apos;m experiencing , if it &apos;s not going to be constantly contradiction , and even with except for excells , a child out of themselves will be an awful for itself .
See , doctor Kean had thought change .
He understood that there is a difference between the empathy and what somebody could do with it .
And in the course of time , my thinking has changed , if you had asked me as 15-year-old , or I would have my art legs for real benewed , I had no doubt .
I was supposed to such as normality .
If you ask me now than I know it now , I &apos;ll know it &apos;s like that .
That &apos;s because of the experiences that I haven &apos;t despite the experiences that I haven &apos;t despite the experiences .
Perhaps this changed in me because I &apos;m more exposed to people who have opened for me than those doors who wanted me to do me and shadom .
Look , you have only one human being shows you to have the open up of your own force , and there &apos;s gone .
And if you can somebody the key to his own massive , the mind is so received , if you can , and in an essential moment a door for somebody can opening them in the best way .
You learn them to open up the doors .
And the exactly meaning of the word for the word of amazing exactly
That meaning , that what &apos;s inside is to form and bringing out , potential , potential to outside .
So again , what potentially potential , what potential we want to bring out ?
There was a case-study in the 1960s , in English , where they from gymnasia to school-nation-to-city study .
It &apos;s called the extension of challenge . In the United States , we needed to be the extremely challenge .
And they reshare for 9, 98, and so on and so on .
It &apos;s a very difficult packager , the best teacher , etc .
Great a three massive , they gave 4-meets , they were telligent , and told them that they were 10 , that they were intelligent .
At the end of the three massively majority .
The heart rate of these study is that they were telling that they were telling the meaning of the challenge that they were dealing .
And that happened after three months .
Those of them in school wareness , the people who had gotta .
A critical part of this research was that the teachers were also wildlife .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that there was a sinterchange .
And there was a teenaged : these are the present of teenth , this one with square .
And so they were going to put , and so they treated sea .
I think the only real hands disabled a mindset of spirit , a collapsed mind .
It doesn &apos;t see a beauty .
He didn &apos;t have our natural curiosity , child doesn &apos;t have anymore and not our attached ability .
If we can stay the spirit of the mind to be hope , to keep beauty in itself and others and others , to sequency and fantasy fabulous and fantasy , we use the wildlife .
And as a spirit of these qualities , we &apos;re able to be able to realize new reality .
I want to finish with a poem century Persian poem century Persian poem , Having my friend Jacques on telling me .
The god is called &quot; The god for four words knowledge
Every child knows Godd , not the God of beef , not the God of clottery , but the God who repeated to the extent that he repeat repeat repeatendance with mircumber , challenge , dance with mine .
Thank you .
