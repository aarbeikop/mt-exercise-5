A couple of years ago , Peter Skillman , at TED, a design competition .
The marshmallow-challenged .
And the idea is pretty simple : Grepeared to make a very high work with twenties of spaghety-to-spaghetti , a massive and a marshmallowed .
The marshmallow the marshmallow .
Basically , although it turns out , it turns out , it turns out that these assignment people to work together .
And because I decided this is an interesting idea , I decided to take it into a design workshops .
And it was a big successful .
Since then , I &apos;ve done this exercise in about 70 design workshops around the world with exercise , designers , and even with Fortune of Fortune , and even with Fortune 50-business .
And this exercise gives us deep insights in how people collaboratory , and I want a few of that .
Actually , the first step is the first step that humans on the case .
She &apos;s resources for how it &apos;s going to play , play with power games .
Then they go planners .
They sketches and monstruggling .
The biggest part of the time they &apos;re increasingly construction of spaghettes .
And at the end , when time , it &apos;s almost like , somebody packages the marshmallow them to do a piece of the marshmallow , putting back up !
They &apos;re wonder their tools .
But what &apos;s really happening , usually , is that the case of the massive realization in a sense , because the weight of the marshmallow for the entire construction and collapse .
almost people have more of that extraordinary extraordinary present moments than other .
And what of the worst has been studied with a MBA.
They play , they play attached , and they make sure for wells .
And besides there are a teams that a lot more excell-empathy .
And the best amount of them have only been studied column .
That &apos;s a impressive .
And Peter tells , they &apos;re not just making the highest building .
So , what you &apos;re going to ask about : How can you dive ? What do that ?
Peters answer issues , it &apos;s a Gone of the children &apos;s boss to be the boss of Spagency BV.V.
They don &apos;t waste time with power games .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And that &apos;s the economists have been training for the only right thing .
And then they go out that out .
But what &apos;s happening , when they were the marshmallow the marshmallow is that they don &apos;t greed time . And dance ?
It &apos;s a disaster .
Counds sound , certainty ?
And what &apos;s going to do .
is that they with the marshmallow .
They build prototypes, and new prototype pes...
and the marshmallow upper , so they have more opportunity to repair .
Develusively realization as the basis of an iterative processes .
At the metaneously , the children get a feedback about what a feedback .
So the building prototypes is very important .
But let &apos;s see how different teams it .
The average for the mediums is about 50 cmill .
economists there half ,
It &apos;s a massive , better than the extent .
Who does it spend ?
chitects and engineering , happily .
The highest construction that I &apos;ve seen was a high-empathy .
And what &apos;s extremely understanding , and self-rement measuring geometric structures are the key to build stable to build a stable collability .
CEO-average , something better than average .
But now it becomes interesting , if you get a secretary at the team , they &apos;re going to get a secretary .
Incredible . You can see the team and think-to-based wind .
And that can you see from teaching . And value ?
although they are good at support to support .
They managent , understanding processes .
And every single team that is focused and attention for the work of that team is going to good come .
And specialized and supportive skills to lead to a successful .
If you normally get 10 teams to do this , there will be a magnituation of a state work .
And I tried to try something interesting .
I thought , we make it a little exciting .
So I &apos;m going to walk to software from the winning teams .
And what do you think these designers are defining ?
What happened ?
The next ones .
No single team had built a state .
It &apos;s been an inches to be an inch , a centimetered , was enough to get to price .
What &apos;s interesting is that a higher inside higher consequences higher .
We have the exercise repeately for the exercise .
And what do you think about that then ?
So they &apos;re now understanding prototypes .
And this team changed the worst team in one of the worst team in one of the business .
They made the highest construction in the at least .
So that &apos;s a good lesson for us about the nature of reward and successful .
You may say , &quot; Why would somebody want to spend somebody want to spend time to spend a marshmallow-challenge ?
And the reason , I work with creating digital tools and processes to get teams to build teams and visual effectively , computer games and visual effectively .
And the marshmallow-challenge helps them up to the hidden assumption .
Does , honest , honest project has its own marshmallowed , nothing ?
The challenge is a biggeds an experiencing an amazing language , an amazing branched the best prototype .
And so that &apos;s the value of the experience of the exercise of the exercise .
And for having interests , interested in marshmallowchallenge .
On this blog , you can see how to build the mashmallows .
There are stacking structions .
There are preview of how people all around the world have tricks and adaptation .
There are also a global records .
And the fundamental lesson , think that is really a contacts .
It &apos;s the protein of all of our sensory , and that we use our best knowledge and exploring for the challenge that our light .
And sometimes a small prototype prototype of this experience to be affected to make sense of extraordinary memorize .
And that makes a big differently .
Thank you very much .
So , let &apos;s assume suppose we &apos;re about a machine , a big machine , a major machine , a major machine , and it &apos;s still a time machine for a while , and it &apos;s still a time machine .
And everyone here .
You can remember in time or forward in the time , but not here and now .
I &apos;ve been gotten what you would choose , because I &apos;ve asked this question all kinds of friends , and they all want to go back .
They all want to go back to the time before authority of Twitter or Twitter or Twitter , empowered ,
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s a certain hang of nosts to state .
And I can come in there .
But I don &apos;t hear there , I have to say that .
I don &apos;t want to return back , and not because I &apos;m so advental -- but for the potential of these planetary .
They &apos;re not going to go forward , who are going forward .
So I want to go in the case , and I want to move forward in the time .
We &apos;re living in the violent time on this planet on what area , but what area of wealth , wealth cansensory , cansending of disease .
Never was a while there was a time .
My grandparents are all the size of 60s .
My grandparents did all the 70s .
And my parents are already at the 800s .
So I &apos;m going to get a piece of a piece in the 90 .
But it &apos;s not just about ourselves .
There &apos;s a lot more on the game .
A kid in New Delhi is born in New Delhi has a life-expectancy to that of the wealth man in the world .
Think about that . That &apos;s an incredible facts .
And why is it true ?
The smallpox . The smallpox are people on this planet of life .
They had an influence on the demography of this world bigger than any war .
But they don &apos;t existence . They &apos;re far .
We &apos;ve disgusting them . Pof!
In the wealthy world disease , which is a generation of millions of people threat , as good as not millions of people , as well .
Diftery , rodehunched child ,
And anybody else here &apos;s what that ?
Inentiny , modern medicine our possibilities to suppose argument , are all triumps of scientific method .
And for me , is the scientific method , trying to figure out whether it works and nonetheless , one of the biggest business of humanity .
That &apos;s the good news .
But the only good news is that the only good news because there &apos;s a number of other problems , it &apos;s a lot of other problems , and it &apos;s a date for all of our resources , there &apos;s still a multiple of people in this world , every single day , there &apos;s still a dark of people in this world every day .
Their number of takes , and it takes sense .
And not just date , we also have our imagination to pollutting the world &apos;s resources .
Drinkable water , agricultural competition , rainforest , gas: they &apos;re disappearance , and if we &apos;re not capable of innovation , and if we &apos;re not able to innovation .
The question is : Can we have this question .
And I think it &apos;s clear that we &apos;re able to be able to make sure for the realization of the argument without the country we live existence .
I think we can see these world of energy forms that are not in the realm of energies .
I believe that morning , etc . I don &apos;t think , that &apos;s not a wall .
But now , I think that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to wake up at night -- one of the things that I woke up at night .
Never we have been so dependent on scientific progressive progressive progress , and never we &apos;ve been able to make the use of it today .
We &apos;re on the threshot of the most amazing advantage of the most amazing thing .
And I think we really think that hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of time , to find a time of the Ulight-involved , to find a time that we &apos;re so against this incurrency of heart , and fought in more areas and fought in areas .
People hunting their believed faith with sweek of heart that it &apos;s impossible for it .
And listening , everybody has right on his own mental ; everybody even has the right on the right , but you don &apos;t know where you don &apos;t have a right on a right ?
You don &apos;t have a straight on your own facts . Neading your own facts .
And I &apos;ve done a while about it to realize that .
And a 10 years ago , I wrote a story about inenting for The New Yorker &apos;s extremely narratives .
I was astonishing opposite , against what in fact , the most effective measurely for the public health in history .
I didn &apos;t know what I knew , so I wrote a story and I went on .
A little bit later , I wrote a story of genetically depleasure .
It &apos;s a self-de, but it turns worse .
People are challenge .
So I wrote there , but a story , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people do this , but I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought of this is extremely because of the moleculate moleculate molecules on a focusing on the nature .
Mard , knows , I &apos;m doing what I wrote . I wrote a story and I wrote a story of the day . I &apos;m a journalism ; we &apos;re going to do it , we &apos;re going to eat and that &apos;s date .
But these stories continuing me view , I couldn &apos;t make it extremely surrounded .
And because the fanaticians who made me , in fact , no fanaticians .
They were challenging , right issue .
like the people in this business .
And it was just that what me was so solid .
But then I thought , well , let knows , honest , honest , we are at a moment in this world , we &apos;re not going to have to provide a multimately , as a well-empaign .
We &apos;re talking about twins .
We &apos;re talking about , ironic about it as between the history .
Take advantage .
OK, there are reasons , and I think we also know that we know them .
We &apos;ve lost the believing institutions , in the science , and in science , and there is no reason why no reason why no reason .
You only have to drop a couple of names and understanding people .
Tshjernobyl, the Challenge , Viox, mass destroyl, mass destruction , not good perceived ponline .
I mean , you can see yourself .
There are questions and problems with those people that we thought they always equally easy .
So , you &apos;re skeptics .
Now , imagine , ask evidence and evidence of al, you don &apos;t have anything .
But now , if you get evidence , you &apos;ve got to address them , and you don &apos;t have to be so good .
And the reason I can say that is that we &apos;re now in an unprecently angstep that we hope is going to be wasn as possible as possible .
About 12 years , there was a horrible story published that a connected between the epidemic of autism and the inenting against majority and the ingenuine .
Angsting .
Hopportunity challenged to go , or this true .
And that &apos;s a very severe seekend .
The data came up .
She found in the United States , in English , in Swedish , in Candirty , and all the result , not at least .
But it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter because we think of anecdotes, we believe what we &apos;re seeing and what we think , and what we think we really think .
We cannot believing a bunch of an official government of an official governmental institution that we all of that ?
But you know water ?
The consequences were catastrophic , and it &apos;s about this : The United States are one of the few countries in the world in the world where the number of intings against the majority and collapse .
And that &apos;s a shake , and we should be harm .
Take terribly .
What &apos;s going to do with us that we were able to decide that we could decide it ?
And I understand what I understand .
Who &apos;s going to get some measures here ?
Have anybody of this audience ever see anyone see in the audience ?
Come not often .
And this is not multiple , but it happened last year , 160,000 times in the world .
That &apos;s a lot of killed by maze , 20 per hour .
But because it &apos;s not going to be here , we can involve the relatively and people like Jenny McCarthy Banny McCarthy to spread things like Oprah and Larry King and Larry King .
And they can do that because they can &apos;t make a distinct between ordinary and accidental conditions .
They don &apos;t really understand that these things look , but it &apos;s practical practical .
And that &apos;s something that we need to learn and that we need to learn , and that we have to teach teacher .
This guy was a bright , Jonas Salkay .
He &apos;s remember of one of our worst .
Not an angusting , no death multimate multiple . Polios .
And that man in the middle .
It &apos;s called Paul Offith .
He developed a variety of the clip against the clip of mental .
The rescued the lives of such as 400,000 to 500,000 kids in the third world .
Good , right ?
Well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul tonist with prospital and how they &apos;re living .
and that people should be able to stop yourself .
And so he says it .
So Paul is a terrorist .
If he &apos;s a public allows than it can only do it , but in regularly of supposed .
He gets home phone calls because there are people who are price to say they know where his children are schools .
And what Paul is that Paul has empathy has developed .
I don &apos;t have to say it , but I don &apos;t need to be unreceived .
Take them out and the diseases will return terrible disease , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
We have back in this country , and back .
And it &apos;s still going to be soon , there will be kids going to die if there &apos;s enough disease .
And they will not only be easy and killing .
What polio ? That &apos;s cooking . Why none ?
And a former fellow employed me to wrote weeks , and said she said , &quot; Well , she said , &quot; Well , she pretty much more likely to say .
No one has ever since me that .
She wasn &apos;t necessarily against police .
In no case .
Good .
What ?
Yesterday , polio didn &apos;t prevent anymore .
Marthroughout morning , perhaps , maybe somebody on an airplane in Lagos, and he &apos;s flying to Los Angeler , he &apos;s now above right now .
Within a couple of hours , a car and comes to Long for Long behind , where he &apos;s going to sit down to one of those fantastic TED .
And he doesn &apos;t realize that he is with a paralyzed disease , and we don &apos;t know , because that &apos;s date .
That &apos;s the planet for us .
We &apos;ll rather tackling in the gang .
Have everyone tomorrow are vitamences smart ?
Echinacea little bit of an oxide for the day ?
I know because half the Americans every day .
They &apos;re alternative drug , and they use alternative drug , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we discovering that they need .
The data is always reinforce again .
They don &apos;t make your urine dark . And practical never practical .
Okay , if you want to spend 28 dollars for dark urin , you know , Dan is that .
Dark . Dark .
Why do we do that ? I think I understanding it , we hate Big Pharmation .
We hate the government . We &apos;re hate that police .
That has to cooking . Our healthcare reward .
They are that for millions of our country .
They are amazingly heard and disturbing even for those of us that they can permiterent .
So we &apos;re going to walk away from away , and where are we going to walk ?
We &apos;re in the arms of Big Placeboard .
Damazing . I love Big Placeboard .
Mealization , this is very , very , because the entire mess is mess , and we spend on it .
I &apos;ve got a few of those things here .
Gink , chinacaim , chinacai , I don &apos;t even know what that isn , but we don &apos;t care about it .
And you know water ? If I &apos;m telling the people against me , and they put them on me , and they say , what can you get ? Let the people .
They &apos;re feeling .
And you know water ? You &apos;re wrong .
I think it can &apos;t care about whether it &apos;s the secretary of the health service of the health service service , I &apos;m not going to be a consequence to what my experts about mammography .
or the other cancer cancer cancer cancer that are of coffee .
And if you start to replace evidence and science by believed and magic , you end up to end .
Then you get in the South Africa of Thabo Minki .
He &apos;s responsible for 400,000 people of his people &apos;s death to death that babroots , button and quote , buttton and quote , viral resources that can travel the death of AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of non-thousands of nation in a country that has been planted by this disease .
Don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t tell me that these things .
They have .
Now , the most thoughtful epidemic of an epidemic that we now have the absurd of genetic extent of genetic extent .
It &apos;s an idisease . It &apos;s got to stop .
It &apos;s about today , metaphors .
It &apos;s ideology , no science .
Everything that we cut , every single of richness , every single thing is extremely challenge , every single of humanity .
Remember that there is no mandards of mandards are not a mandards of wareness of wareness .
It wasn &apos;t a water meloent .
Even no Christbs bomb . They all come from ourselves .
We empowered them in the last 1,000 jarently .
Some of those products benefit and others .
We &apos;re not exploration of what we &apos;re doing .
Now , we can do a little bit more regulately .
En, certainty there are risks to connection .
But we can produce rice to produce millions of producing millions of life and longer .
You don &apos;t want to address ?
I have to hostile that I don &apos;t understand .
We don &apos;t want genetic modified .
And what about what ?
Well , this is a lot of chemist : too many chemicals , pesticidences , monoculary , monocultural , monoculary , we don &apos;t want to be a giant fields of the air .
We don &apos;t love companies that take patents of living on living dinner .
We don &apos;t want the property rights property rights .
And you know what I answered on that ?
You have a similar . Let &apos;s do something about it .
It &apos;s value . Our problem is overwhelmed , but that &apos;s not a science .
It has nothing to do with science .
This is going to be the morality , patentless .
Science is not a society .
No land .
Even no ideas . It &apos;s a processional .
It &apos;s a proces, and sometimes it works and sometimes .
But the idea that we have to prevent the science to prevent her work because we &apos;re really afraid of it , and will heat millions of people to heat the only wealthy welry .
Weat jump , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to need to have more empathy than moving .
70s .
This is a graph the distribution of the investment in Africa for the last 30 year .
Schandaled . Schandalgory .
They really need it , and we remember it .
And the reason ? Genetic argument .
We don &apos;t want to humans as a cassave example , as a cassave examples .
Cassave is the daily equivalent of a half of mental mental .
It &apos;s just a bunch of calory .
It doesn &apos;t collapse enough for protein and scientists , and scientists are doing something about that .
almost people can eat without blind .
They wouldn &apos;t answer , and you know water ?
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t cute heart , but it would be fine .
And all I have to say , &quot; Why are we display ?
I mean , let &apos;s say , &quot; Well , why are we suddenly that ?
that we don &apos;t want to share with gene ?
This is going to be transmit from gene . Have nothing to do with chemicals .
Also , not with our ridiculous passion for hormonths , our desire , more desire .
It &apos;s not about Rice Krief , it &apos;s about people in life .
and it &apos;s about that we start to understand what that wants to say .
You know watching water ?
If we don &apos;t do it and continuous as we are going to be , we &apos;re going to do something that we don &apos;t want to remember : the mind tech colonialize mind .
I don &apos;t find any other way to describe this better .
It &apos;s self-size and longer , our indigames , and we need to really do something about it .
So , after this unimaginable remaintainly , maybe you &apos;d like to suggest , you &apos;d like to say , with this ridiculous timeless of travel .
Absolute , I want to date date .
Now , she &apos;s still stuck in the present , but we have an amazing probabilities .
We can do it for everything we want to use .
We can bring them to a sense of them , and we &apos;re going to bring them to where we are wild .
We &apos;ve got to continue with these elements , and we need to keep identify , but if we &apos;re going to keep and forward , we &apos;ll be happy to be happy .
I know that we have the artistic , and that , for what to me to me , something that the world needs to science .
Thank you .
Thank you .
A folumnist of the Los Angeles Times--
Steve Lopezy , walking on a day ...
through the center of Los Angelescape
when he heard music .
It came from a male .
A black male .
Charter , lunch , homeless .
And I was played on a celebrate with two string .
I &apos;m telling now that many of you all science
because the collums of Steve the basic ...
for a view of a movie .
Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Steve Lopez...
and Jamie Foxx who of Nathony Ayers...
the classic showed --
those are more likely to recognize career ,
because he was suffering a schizophrenia .
Nathanel stopped with the Juilliard-conservatory , length --
And 30 years later , he skiing homeless .
by the poorest streets of Los Angeler .
You ought to read Stemplate , or the movie .
Next only for the beautiful band...
that died between these two male .
But also to see which role music playful music .
it &apos;s an instrumental role , if I say , you know ,
to Nathaniel from the street .
I met Ayers in 20088...
two years in a Disney-concertal .
He had listened to an execution of the 1th and 4th symphony of the methovens --
and backstage and represented .
He spoke on a job and social realizes
Just about Yeah and Hillary Clintongue .
Dodgers never said the Dodgers would never say the World Ssions .
All the attacky of a tricky fours ,
in the last part of the fourth symphony of the ethovens .
We talked about music . Later , I got a mail from Stear ...
that was wrote that Nathaniel to wrote a view of me .
You have to know that Nathaniel doesn &apos;t want to be treatment .
When he was treated when he was treated shocket therapy .
chlorpromopazine .
and that has draw it for his life .
And the result is that he &apos;s useful .
attacks of schizophrenia .
The worst of the worst attacks
plows up .
and he disappears .
And he &apos;s going to talk about the street ...
and the wildlife with that narrative and the worder in his head ,
that folks at once .
Nathaniel invented in such an agitated state ,
when we understanding our first lesson .
He had a malized in sense .
He was gone .
And he talked about ...
invisible demons and smoke ...
and someone who wanted it to be a sleep in slap .
I was bang .
Nargument for self-meeting .
that I &apos;d gotta .
that he would take away from socket in sweek ,
and that I would be relationship to the violent ,
when I started talking about toonline
and arpeggiographs and other exciting examples .
from what you to view in four-lessons .
So I started playing .
I played the first part of the four-concert of the vioil .
As I playful .
I have a clear changing .
in the eyes of Nathania .
It was like an invisible medicine his work .
A chemical reaction that my game
the catalyst of catalyze .
The manic window of Nathanelian
changed in understanding .
In silly curiosity of curiosity and free .
As a wonder , he switched to a wood-tools ,
and started playing on it .
Take the fragments of viownership --
that I &apos;m going to recognize . Mendelss ,
Taikovsynsylabel .
We began to talk about music , from Bach...
to be ethoven and Brahms...
Brug , all the Buknership .
From Bartter to Esa-Peka Salonene .
I mean , I don &apos;t know .
a encyclopedical musical musical knowledge ,
but he was touched by that personally .
And he talked about it with the meaning .
and it &apos;s understanding and message of my mind ,
from the Los Angeles Philharmons .
By making music and about music ,
This guy changed .
from the paranoid .
that right ?
from Los Angeles had been comics
in a charmante,
brilliant , classic created musicus .
Music maeds . Music changes .
For Nathaniel is a healthy .
And by music , he can be able to his thoughts
and department ,
through his fantasy and creativity
in reality .
Taware of air .
have troubledged attacks .
I think that the essential of art .
That &apos;s why we do music .
And that we do something that in all of us ,
deep in our nuclear .
Our extraordinary .
And that we see through our artistic lens...
through our crativity that allowed to reality .
The reality of that expression --
Take our bottom .
We &apos;re going to inspired , inspired and united .
Nathania .
Actually through music , a group of friends .
The reason of music brought it back .
in a family of musician ...
who assuming him ,
those are languages .
and he respected him .
I &apos;ll always stay music with Nathania .
It &apos;s now in Walt Disney Concert Hall isen .
or on the street . He reminds me of it .
why I &apos;ve been a musicus .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Robert Gup .
I want to play something that I &apos;ve got to play a shame of cellists .
It means .
I &apos;m Jane McGongal. I &apos;m a game designer .
All 10 years I gave online game .
And my goal for next decade is to make it as easy to make it easy to save the world as it is in game .
Now , I &apos;ve got a plane for a plane , and that plan is to convince more humans to spend more time more time to spend more time to the play of bigger and better game game .
At this moment , we &apos;re playing three of a week online game .
Some of you think , more likely , that &apos;s a lot of time to play games .
Perhaps too much while there are so much more important problems in the real world .
But actually , I think , in my research at the Institute For the Toes , which is the opposite where issue .
Three on hours a week for a week for long enough to solve problems .
Now , I believe that if we want to take the next century on this planet , that we have to incredibly enormously .
I have realized that we need for 21 a.m.
And that &apos;s a strange ideas , so I &apos;ll be able to say , I &apos;m going to make it sense .
And if we want to make sure problems like hungry , climate change , global conflict , worldwide , I believe we need to try to play weekicks at least 21-year-year-year-old games to the end of the next decade of the next decade of Neum.
This is the reason . This photographs reasonably good together for the future of games are so important for the future of humanity . Eight .
This is a portrait by a photographer , Phil Toleddance .
He wanted to catch the games of the games .
So he put a camera for gamers of gamers ,
And this is a classic realization of the gentlement .
Number , if you don &apos;t go gammer , you &apos;re a little bit of a nuances in this photograph .
And you can see the sense of the feeling , a little bit of angusting , but also intense consistent focus to a very hard problem .
If you put a gamer down here , you &apos;ll have a couple of nuances : the view and mouth is a sign of optimismely .
The major brows up to above to be a sign of surprising .
This is a gamer that &apos;s at the point of something that &apos;s hot .
Ah , you know . Okay .
So we have a couple of gamers here .
It &apos;s an extremely positively positive , which is so incredibly positively positively positive , that you know .
It was almost not to imagine .
And when you go down there , you &apos;re a surprised to figure out what you &apos;re really maintainly art .
This is a gamer at the point of view of view profit .
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problems around the world , we &apos;re going to try to packaging for the next century .
The face of somebody , against all the expectations , at the point is to exciting an empathy profit .
But unfortunately , we see this face in the daily life , we &apos;re trying to packaging problems .
This is what I think I &apos;m going to be Ben National in the Laware calling .
And this is me actually a towel . Can you can see the facility ? Ja. Good .
This is I &apos;m going to be Ben Naware of Good in the Levelusion .
This is a piece graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeling California , where I did my PhD about why we are better in games than in the real life .
And this is a problem that a lot of gamers .
We don &apos;t feel good in the reality , as we are in games .
And I mean , not just successful , even though that makes part of it .
We &apos;re going to be more in game . But I mean , but I mean , I &apos;ve also been motivated to do something that , inspired to work together .
And when we are in a game world , I believe that most of us the best version of ourselves word the best version of ourselves , the most probability of ourselves , the most probability .
the most likely to be as long as it is requires as long as it is to remain , to a failure .
And if we were in the real life , a failure , when we &apos;re confront , when we &apos;re confront of a failure , we don &apos;t feel often .
We feel overwhelming . We &apos;re feeling our overwhelmed .
We feel frustrated , maybe depressed us , frustrated or cynishes .
We never have those feelings when we &apos;re games .
they don &apos;t exist in game .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was to washing for a moment .
What &apos;s part of games makes it impossible we feel like we don &apos;t feel anything ?
How can we take those feelings of games and to work in the real world ?
So , I looked games like Word of War-wearing games , which is the ideal cooperative environment to solve problems .
And I began to make sense of remarks that are allowed to make sense in the online global .
The first thing I noticed is that every time you in one of those online games , particularly World of Warantee , there &apos;s a lot of various diversity that you like to have a global reason for me , measure .
But not just a mission , a mission that mission is a mission that &apos;s appropriately extremely your living in games . Yisten ?
Dush , you can see it .
They never give you a challenge you don &apos;t .
But it &apos;s at the potential of your opportunity . So you have to do a lot of time .
But there &apos;s no employment in World of Warld of wildlife .
You can &apos;t sit down .
There &apos;s always something specific and important that has to be done .
And there &apos;s a lot of contribute .
Every place where you gathering , there are hundreds of thousands of people who are willing to get your epic mission .
And that &apos;s something that we &apos;re in the real life very difficult , that sense that there is a lot of collaborators .
And also that there &apos;s an epic story , this invent story that tells us why we are here and what we do .
And then all the positive feedback that we get genuine .
You &apos;ve already heard of a lively riches and plus-force an intelligence .
Supping constant back-stream , we get into the real life .
When I here from this stage , I &apos;m not going to get a message , I won &apos;t get any mountain , plus-20 ideas .
I don &apos;t get feedback in the real life .
Number the problem with collaborative online worlds like Warld of Warld , is that it &apos;s so far to be the time at a point of view , that we decided to spent our time to spent our challenge to spent our time on games .
It &apos;s just better than reality .
So far now , World of Warld of Warld welling , 5.93 million years to spend the virtual problems of Azeroth to solve Azeroth .
Number that &apos;s not a bad thing .
It sounds maybe bad .
In order to do that , 5.93 million years ago , 5.93 million years ago ,
That was the first primary , justifying primary .
Okay , so if we &apos;re talking about the amount of time we investing in the game of game is the only way to think about it is to even knowledge of time in the context of the context of time in the context of the contextraordinary , which is an extraordinary thing .
But it &apos;s also disease . It turns out to be a lot of time to play with so much time to play of measuring , we &apos;re going to change as people .
We evolve to a kind of more cooperative and education .
This is what I believe .
Duses think about this interesting .
It was published by a researcher of the Carnegie Mellon University .
The average young medium , in a country with an important game cultural game , it &apos;s already going to engaged for the time he &apos;s 21 years old .
Numbers is a very interesting digit for two reasons .
Ten hearing , for kids in the United States is 080 hours , the exact amount of time that you spent at school from the fifth reading the fifth year until your studies as you always appropriate .
So we have a wine wildlife of education where young young learning about the games like they do a lot about the games in schools .
Some of you have a memory of Malcom Gladell-empathy of Outlider .
So you &apos;ve heard of his successful theory , the existence theory .
It &apos;s on this amazing , cognitive scientific research is based that as we can control for a long study , for a long study that we can control for the age of 21 , we have virtuous virtual in words .
We &apos;re going to be good at what we do as the best we do as the best of the world .
And so , what we &apos;re seeing now is a whole generation young of generation .
Duses , the big question , Where are gamers that are going to be pretty well-empathy .
If we can figure behind that , we would be virtual unprecedented to human potential .
This is the number of people who now in the world at least one hours a day games .
These are our virtuoes .
500 million people who are very good at extraordinary .
And in the next decade , we &apos;re going to have an extraordinarily good at gamers that extraordinary good at something .
If you don &apos;t remember it , this compete .
The gaming-industry is consools to develop that very little current and needs with wireless telephone networldband Internet , so that gamers of all over the world &apos;s all over the world , especially play , Brazil .
They &apos;re expected to a sense of gamers against the decades .
And that brings us to 1.5 m.
So , I just wondered by these games like the games of these games are wordented .
I &apos;ve got four meaning for the first fuel is burning optimism .
Okay , you can see as extreme self-motivation .
Brand-optimism is the wants to get a handle , to be combined with the belief , combined with the belief that we have a reasonable opportunity on success .
Gamonds always believe that a massive wild of wind , and that it &apos;s always worth it &apos;s always worth to move , and then now .
Gamers night .
Gammers are virtual in the weight of a poet social standards .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that we have people rather after we have a play with them , even though they &apos;ve played us .
The reason is that you need to play with somebody .
We confidence that they &apos;re going to continue to spend their time , that they &apos;re going to be played to play for the course .
So , a play with somebody collaborate the bottom , the trust and the collaboratory .
And as a result , we actually build more social relationship .
Salive productivity .
You know , there &apos;s a reason , that the average World of Warld , 22 hours a week player 22 hours a week time .
That &apos;s because we know that when we play a game , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we received or anywhere .
We know that as people are made to delivered , useful work .
And gamers are willing to work hard , when they give the right work , if they give the right work .
And finally , epic meaning .
Gammers are like to received from planetary crime , stories of planetary scales .
Now , a tiny , a small weat that clearly .
You &apos;re all Wikipedia , the biggest wiki in the world .
The biggest wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 articles , is the World of the World of Warld ,
Five million people use it every months .
They have more info about World of Warld of the Internet acting any other topic than any other topic .
They build an epic story .
They build a epic source of knowledge about World of Warld ,
So , those are four superforces that are combined to one thing .
Gamers are super-engineering , hopeful balance .
These are people who believe that they believe that they &apos;re allowed to change the world .
And the only problem is they believe that they have to change virtual worlds and not the real world .
And that &apos;s the problem that I try .
There &apos;s an economist , Edward Castrono .
His work brilliant . He &apos;s searches the reason why people spend so much time and energy and money on online global .
And he goes to say , &quot; Well , we &apos;ve been touched from nothing less than a real mass exoso to virtual worlds and online meworldview .
And he &apos;s a economist , so he &apos;s rational rational .
And he gt... Nextinct , I &apos;m a game design .
But he &apos;s saying this , because gamers can make more of gamers in a world than in the real life .
They can have more social relationships in games than in the real life .
They get better feedback and feel more likely in games than in games .
So he says it &apos;s perfectly logical that gamers spend more time in virtual worldings than in real world .
Number , I &apos;m going to ask that rational , at this moment .
But it &apos;s not an optimal situation .
We need to do the real world in a game more lifetime .
So I &apos;m going to take my realization of something that 2,500 years ago .
This is an ancient dobusiness , made of sheep knowledge . Okay ?
For we had cool controllers , we had challenging cool .
And this is the first piece of tools for that , designed by mental .
And if you &apos;re working the ancient Greek historian Herodotus knowledotus , maybe this story .
the inventors of the first game and why they invented it .
Herodly says that games played , particularly invented in the room Lydia dark .
And apparently , the hunrequired of Lydia decided that the king of Lydia decided to do something .
People supplies . People .
It was an extreme situation . They had to have an extreme for an extreme for .
Duses Herodotuses , they found out business baggery and a massive policy .
One day , eat least eats .
The next day , plays everyone plays .
And they would be solid bottomed in their playing , because they play are so book , and damn us under us in such as such as extraordinary productivity that they wouldn &apos;t eat .
The next day , they played games .
The day after it was search .
And according to Herodotus , they had this 18 years .
They survived a famine by eating one day , and the next day .
And I think this is exactly how we use games today .
We use games to emerge from the real world .
We &apos;re using them to escape from everything that was broken in the real world , everything that &apos;s not happiness to the real world , and we get what we need of game of game .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end .
This is very exciting .
After 18 years , Herodotus didn &apos;t get the hungry .
So the king of the king that they were going to take a last dobusiness play .
She &apos;s realized the entire quick in two .
And they played one dead games , and the winners of that game on a epic adventory .
They would be Lydia latent , and looking for a new hell .
At enough people living in order to survive of the lifestyle that there might be wareness the civilization .
Number this sounds , right ?
But recently , DNA evidence to that the Etrusk , who would lead to the Roman empends , DNA as the ancient Lydiells .
And so , scientists have suggested that Herodotussians have been suggested .
And geologists invented from a climate change that nearby 20 years that almost expensive the famine .
So this crazy story could be true .
It could be that they saved their culture through games by playing games , by escape to a game for 18 years , and then inspired so much , and then inspired so much of the games that they save their entire civilization in that way they save their whole civilization in that way .
Okay , we can .
We &apos;re playing Warity since 1994.
It was the first time the strategy time strategy of the World of Warld , which was 16 years old .
And they played with Durban eight during 18 year , we play for 16 years .
I &apos;m telling that we &apos;re ready for our own evil game .
Number , for half the population of the population looking for a new global .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do for 21 a.m.
We &apos;re going to leave half our agreement a day for an hour per day , until we have problems in the real world .
Now , I know what you &apos;re asking for you to ask : How are we going to empowering that problems of Wel, which is where I &apos;ve been dedicated to the last couple of year-old , at the Institute For For the Tcome .
We have a banner in our building in Palo Alto, and it presses our standpoint of how to deal with the future .
We don &apos;t want to predict him .
We want to shape him .
We want to represent us to the best possible .
And then we want to give people the meaning to reality .
We want to imagine our presents , and then give people the resources of the resources to express their employment .
I &apos;m going to show you a short three games that I &apos;ve made a attempt to give people the resources to make their own desire for the future .
Okay , this is World Without .
We made this game in 20070s .
This is an online game for you to see a text of oil is trying to survival .
The text is fiction , but we &apos;re telling enough online content to believe that it really , and to make you believe that it , and to make you real life as though we don &apos;t have any more . Dus, if you don &apos;t start the game game , you &apos;re telling your heart , you &apos;re telling where you hot .
And then we &apos;re giving your real-time currently and data that show you what the exact price of oil , which is not available , how the exactly available , how transportation is influenced , or the schools of the schools of schools or the schools .
And you &apos;ve got to figure out how to live your real life as if this true . And then we ask you a blog about it . And then we ask a blog about a video of extinction .
We started this game with 1,700 players in 20070s .
And we followed them for the three years .
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
Nobody wants to be changing their lifewise , but because it &apos;s good for the world or because we should be told .
But if you didumpe them in an epic adventure and they &apos;re telling :
This is an amazing story and adventure to the adventure .
And that &apos;s what you &apos;d survival to see how you would survive .
The games helped their habits that they learned in this games .
Dus, for the next world-reason , we decided to make higher issue , bigger problems than an oil .
We made a play called Superstruct struck at the Institute For the Superstructure .
The plot was that a supercomputer had realized for 23 years .
And this supercomputer was the name of Global Extinction Awareness System .
We asked people to comment online , almost as a Jerry Bruckheimer .
You know what , Jerry Brubkheimer movie , you form a team .
You &apos;ve got the astronaut , the scientists , the ex-prison , and they have to put together the world .
But in our games , we &apos;ve instead of five people on the thream team , everybody on the dream , and it &apos;s your job to find out your job for the health , the employment of the health , the providing of the health , the conceived the social network .
We showed 8,000 people play the game during eight .
And they spend 500 tremendous creatively resources that you can see if you &apos;re on Google of Superstructure .
And then finally , the last game , we bring it out on three magic . This game is made in collaboration with the World Bank Institute .
If you played the game out , you &apos;re certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Institute as a Social Institutory .
With college with universities all over Zwart African , and we invite them to teach social engineering .
We have a pulled comic . We have a system with levels in skills like local insizes , knowledge , sustainability , vision and invental .
And I &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game please with young , all over the world , especially in the development areas that could be the advantage ; to make their own social entrepreneur to save the world .
So I &apos;ll now go around .
I want to ask a question .
Now , what think of it &apos;s going to happen now ?
We have all these wonderful gamers, we have these games that are just what we could do , but no of them has the real world .
Well , I hope you &apos;re going to be able to do with member , that gamers a sun source , which we can use to heal the real world , that games are a powerful platform for changing .
We have all this incredible superforms of this incredible superssive productivity , the opportunity to make a poet , this sense of burning optimism and the desire to an epic significant meaning .
And I really hope that we can come together to play games that a difference , for this planet , to be a difference on this planet .
And my hope is that you make with me games and play games .
If I look forward to the next decade decades , I know two things that we can imagine , that we can imagine , and we can play every game we can play for every game .
Dush , I hit , leaves the world changing play .
Thank you .
Since some time , I &apos;ve been interested in the process of an effectory .
It can seem strange for a magicious , unless you know , unless you &apos;ve got to think of it to be a measured , that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to be a little bit strongly being believed by a measures , sugar pills , sugar pills the studio effect .
Just because the presence of vulnered that what &apos;s happening to him is a genetic resources or something else .
Before it with pain , particularly , as they dancy in faith , it gets a measurable body , it gets a measurable bodies effectable .
Something that needly becomes the perception .
To make sure that we understand each other , I want to start with you a very simple structure .
And I &apos;ll show you how the verb . This trick is since the 1950s since the 1950s for children .
I &apos;ve been tiny for him as a little boy to the scale in the 1960s .
I &apos;ll explain the trick , I &apos;m going to explain it .
And after that , I explain why I explained him .
This is what happened .
The mesh you can visit ; my hand, you can visit .
I &apos;m going to hold it in this way , I &apos;m going to hold it in this way .
I &apos;m going to my mind my little clip .
And in order to be that there &apos;s nothing in or from my mind , I &apos;m going to be here in my wrist .
You see that there isn &apos;t a movement .
I &apos;m sure for a long time , can nothing in my minute .
The goal is very simple .
I will open my hand up and hope , if it &apos;s good ism , my magnetism will be humans .
The knife becomes so celebrated , that I can shake it , and it &apos;s not on the soil .
Nothing comes in or from my mind , not cheating . And you can observe anything .
Ta-day !
This trick me on young kids who are interested in the magician , because you can learn a lot of learning about ability , because you can teach a lot of learning by studying it .
Even throughout the trick of the trick of each other .
Probably a lot of you .
This is what happened .
I love it .
I say I &apos;m telling my wrip , to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in and from my muses .
That &apos;s supposed .
The reason I &apos;m holding my wrist , because there &apos;s the secret of the illusion of illusion .
At the moment , my hand moved from your view of your view , my wise finger from his original place to one of his original place .
Moomi tricks to emphasn &apos;t had a childhood , sitting in the business .
It &apos;s going to push .
And if I turn into my fingery .
We can remember about why this decade , why you don &apos;t notice that there &apos;s three fingers visible .
That &apos;s because the mind information works in a way that it doesn &apos;t , two , three counter-tells .
But it doesn &apos;t really go , right ? And then I &apos;ll do my hand .
Of course , it doesn &apos;t depends don &apos;t by magnetism , but by the presence of my wise fingering .
And if I close my hand , the self-de.
And if I turn up again , this moves this movement for me to retreat my finger .
I heal this hand . You reach it out .
A beautiful truck for friends and families . Thanks .
Now , what does this have to do with the real-effectation ?
About a year ago I read a research that I read the eyes are completely opened .
I &apos;m not a scientists , so for me was this amazing thing .
It turns out that if you &apos;re dealing an ebo for a white running around the pill of an amazing pill for an afford to be an affordable effect , measurable .
Pretty much like the ebo change , for instance , by a smaller pill , which is a smaller piece of blue , and where you get a letter of pressure , the bo measurer effectively .
Even though , despite of them that no medicine medicine -- they &apos;re sugar pillensions .
But a white pill is not as good as a blue .
Do I got really touched from the upper .
But in the except , it can be a little bit more .
It turns out that capsules are more effectively than which species .
A colored capsule , yellow on one and red on the other hand is better than a white .
Dosering in here .
It &apos;s not twice every day is not as good as three pillense -- I can &apos;t remember the statistics .
But the point --
It &apos;s going to play a role .
And the realization is a role .
And for the ultimate for the ultimate , we need to go to the needle .
Ja, toch? A injection spoke a little injectle-center of a kind of injectory that you have an injectory of an injectory .
This is an enormously powerful image .
It &apos;s lots of mallen than the white pills .
We &apos;re going to leave a graph view , when we can demonstrate diac diac .
The point is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the blue , is not as good as the capability , isn &apos;t as good as the capability .
And no one of all has a real medicine property .
Just your faith , it really makes you believe in your body , and it &apos;s a stronger effectory .
I wanted to see if I could look at that idea in a trick .
I wanted to take something that &apos;s a trick , and really make it living .
We know from that research that when you wild reality , you have to grabbs .
This is a needle of nearly 18 inches . She &apos;s volved .
I &apos;m going to get her a little bit of sterilize .
This is really my meat . This is not a particularly grows .
This is my skin . This is not a Hollyword spectrum .
I &apos;m going to go through my skin , and this needle through my arm , until I go through it .
If you remember , whether if you &apos;re easy flasters , I did this trick yesterday for a couple of friends and some people I don &apos;t know .
A woman was almost of her stick .
So I imagine that if you remember the next 30--- you know , you know , I &apos;m doing the first heavy part .
You can look away , but you can look away .
This is what happened .
Earmed my poorest , I make a small glash .
Sorry, man. Are you this misconversation ?
And then by my skin piece , and then through the other side .
Well , in essence , we &apos;re in essentially situation as with the measures .
A species .
But you can see my fingers , right now ?
I &apos;ll show them . Here &apos;s one , two , three-, fifth .
Ja...
I know people think when they &apos;re in this size .
They don &apos;t know , he &apos;s a meaning enough for themselves , for a few minutes , for a few minutes of his public for a few minutes .
Now , what does that look like , extremely good .
Ja, I know . The people in the back in the back of the room , I don &apos;t think of the Okay , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the other room now is going to be closer to the screen semblance .
Let me show you this nearby .
That &apos;s really my skin . That &apos;s not a Hollywood spectrum .
That &apos;s my business . I can pull that wire .
Sorry. If it &apos;s too much struggling .
People in the room , or people in the room , seeing some years later , it looks like a beautiful spectens , but if it really washing , he would -- there &apos;s a hole and there . If it really would like it -- there &apos;s a hole and long-blood blood blood circulation for a blood years .
Ja, there is .
Normally , I would talk about the needle .
I was going to make my arm and show you that there &apos;s no swonder .
But in this context , and with the idea of something that is that neighborhood and it really makes me the needle and I &apos;m so from the stage .
The next couple of days , I &apos;m going to be several days .
Hopefully you look at that . Thank you very much .
I have a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve been having two .
The first thing seemed more to a passionate affairement .
It was a beautiful fishering , good structures , multi-self-self-self-self-self-a-meeting ,
What a fish .
In fact , it was a fairly growing fish to the assumption of sustainability .
So you felt good at the sales .
I had a relationship with this beauty for months .
And one day , the head of the business and asked me if I wanted to speak on a sustainability of the issue .
Absoluttaneously , said .
Here was a company that was tried to solve that something that was unimaginable for our tubes .
How do we love fish ?
In the past 50 years , we &apos;ve got the sea for the last 50 years .
It &apos;s difficult to overdrive .
90 percent of the major fishing , which is the tune , the heillions , the salmental , sword fishing .
There &apos;s almost nothing more .
Dush , how good it or bad it also ga-fishery , fishery is becomes part of our future .
although there &apos;s a lot of arguments .
Vishing pollutting pollutaneously , they &apos;re inefficiency .
A big mindset .
It has a self-self-self-conversion .
That means that there is fish wild pound to get a pounded in order to get a pound .
Next very sustainable .
And it doesn &apos;t make very good .
So here was a company that it was trying to do good .
I wanted to support them .
The day for the empaign , I called the head PR of the company .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
Dontellent Dontellent to get the facts of getting the facts of being so far in some sense , you &apos;re not pollutgle , you &apos;re not pollutting pollutory .
Now , that &apos;s closely cutched . We &apos;re so far from the coastal , that it disappoints of our fish , and not concentrating .
And he added ,
Which conversion is 2.5 to 12.5 against 10th , aware of extremely extremely extremely inside the massive of extremely extrememory .
2.5 to 12 , wonderful .
Two and a half a watch ? What massive aquatic examples .
Two protein .
Gewellent , said the phone . And the telephone .
And that night , I was in bed and , which is what is a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , I called for the realization , I called Don.
I said , &quot; I think of Don, which are sustainable protein
He said he wouldn &apos;t stop it . He was going around .
So I &apos;ve been on the line with a number of people in the business .
Nobody could answer me a clear me .
Untimately , the main biologist .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
Dong of Dontaneously , which is a couple of sustainable protein
Good , he called the Gudge of meals , and then he said chicken chicks .
And I &apos;m like , for Kipballtycle ,
He said , &quot; It &apos;s Javing , skin , mallized , malcumbers , shawed and processing to make sense of sales .
And I say , &quot; I &apos;m going to -- whose percentage of your feet
All knowledge , two prostate .
Nouth , that &apos;s about 30 center .
And I think , as a Don, which is sustainable to figure out of fishing out
There was a long pause on the line , and he sea , and it &apos;s just too much chicken in the world .
My love for this fish was true .
Neasy because I &apos;m a self-in-fine practice fine practice .
That &apos;s me .
I lost my love for this fish .
This is a fish , which is a very different love story .
It &apos;s the romistic species , the kind of where you get the more of your fish , you know more from the fish .
I was first in a restaurant in a restaurant in south Spants .
A boyfriend journalist spoke for a long time .
She has more infortune .
He came to a table , almost slowly , nearly slowly .
The coat had cookied him .
Almost twice .
It was basically amazing , he was pretty .
Who can do a fish so good , after he cooked out to throw ?
I wasn &apos;t , but this guy .
Let &apos;s take him Miguel .
Actually .
And it doesn &apos;t buy the fish , and he &apos;s not cooking .
And at least not in the way as you and I understand .
He &apos;s a biologist in Veta La Palmoon .
That &apos;s a fishery in the southern Spangle .
At the point of Gaudalquivir .
Until the &apos; 80s was the vulnery in the hands of tinians .
They &apos;re forced hundreds of what actually drasland .
They did that through the country .
They built a complex canalences and they took the water of the country .
It didn &apos;t want them to recognize economics .
and ecological it was a disaster .
90 percent of the birds went killed .
water , for this case , a lot of birds .
And so in 1982 , in 1982 a Spanish environmental ,
What did side of them ?
They turn the water stream .
She was literally the button .
Instead of push water out , they used the channels to latent water .
She &apos;s dealing the channels .
She &apos;s a 1,100 acres big fish big fish , major fish , heart , heart , paling -- and at the same time have Miguel and company have the ecological desert .
The issue is great .
I mean , you &apos;ve never meant something like this .
You know , you know , the horizon that is infinite , and you see , all over the channels , and this distraction , rich tape .
Next so long ago , I was there with Migule .
He &apos;s an amazing venture Charles Darwin and one quarters Darwin and one quarter .
Or ? Kealize his weather , I &apos;m heading and slowed and slowly , sink to muses , and Miguel , gives Miguel , gives a biologeself .
Here he points to a rare Zwar-Schoul-Schoul-Schouthern wind .
Now , he pointed on the mineral needs of the phytoplankage .
And here he sees a groups here he sees a group of the Tanzanian giraf .
It turns out that Miguel most of his career spent in the Mikumi National Park in Africa .
I asked him how he was such a fish expert .
He &apos;s like , he &apos;s Viss ? I don &apos;t know anything .
I &apos;m a relationship . I &apos;m a relationship
And then he talked about rarely rarely and algae and algae and strange water plant .
It wasn &apos;t traffic , it was really fascinating , a kind of biological reality .
It was amazing , but I was in love .
And my head swimming in the cooking piece of high fish that I had the evening for it .
So I suggesting heavy . I say , &quot; How does it come your fish so good swells .
He &apos;s going to the algene .
And I know what I know , the algene , the phytoplanking , the relationship , it &apos;s amazing .
But what food is the fish ?
And what is the realm conversion of the well-empathy
And then he &apos;s going to tell me that it &apos;s such a wealthy system , that the fish eat what they would be in the wild .
The planetary biomass , the phytoplanguage , the animal plankness , which is what the fish is the fish .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-incurrently .
There &apos;s no fresh .
East heard of a farm that animals don &apos;t put her animals ?
I rescuffs about this terrain with Miguel and asked about this with Miguel and asked me , is a place that &apos;s just a site that &apos;s kind of like that I &apos;ve ever been to realize , the measurely successful for the rescue of the measure successful .
At that moment , it was like a movie director .
And we went around the corner and saw the most amazing vision , thousands and thousands of rock flamingames , literally a pink for situation .
That &apos;s successful .
Take a look at their gentlement .
They &apos;re at the party of the party .
Right ? I was totally confusion .
I said , you know , it &apos;s not the party of the party of the feminds
Javor of the mind ,
We &apos;re touching 20 percent of our fish and fish education ,
Last year , this area had more than 250 different species .
It &apos;s now the biggest and one of the most important private air species are being empowered in very well-empathy .
I said , I think , is a bird population that doesn &apos;t do good for the last thing you want to see on a fishery of dealing .
He showed his head , needge .
He said , &quot; It &apos;s extensive , not intensive , intensive .
This is an ecological network .
The flamingames of food .
The shrimp food .
So how pulled the glimpse , the better system .
OK , let &apos;s take a minute .
A matter of the animals are not feeding , and a vulnerable to the vulnery of his hunting his hunters .
A fishery , but also a fish species .
Okay , marries , who should not be swouldn &apos;t have to be sitting here .
They breed in a village 250 miles away , where the bottom conditions are better to build nests .
Every tomorrow they fly 250 miles to the vulnerable .
and every evening 250 miles .
They do that because they can do that because they can take the bottom line of the amazing line .
No graphy .
I suggesting a penguin , so I looked at Miguel .
I said , &quot; I mean , Mign , they &apos;re flying 250 kilometers back to the vulnery and then 250 miles ?
Do they do that for the young for the young memory
And he looked at me at a Whitney Houstent-song quote .
He &apos;s like , he &apos;s doing that for the course of Neasy
I hadn &apos;t remember the skin of my loved fish , which is great washing , and I don &apos;t like fish .
I don &apos;t like that .
It &apos;s that wrange , teacher .
I &apos;m rarely rarely .
But when I took him that restaurant in that restaurant in south Spande-Spanish , he didn &apos;t realize .
And he made sweet and clean , and clean .
I said to Miguel and he kness .
He works like a sponser .
It &apos;s the last defense before something the body in front of the body .
He &apos;s evolved to southern institutes
And then he added : But then , but our water has no nonsense of the water
OK. It &apos;s a question that &apos;s not fish .
A matter of the success of its success .
And then I realized that when he certainly realized that when he said , a big understatstatement , he made a big understatement , because the water that flow through the growth of the Guadalquiver .
And that &apos;s a river that &apos;s a river that rivers of all with rivers , chemical engineering , chemical engineering , pesticide journey .
And it &apos;s just by the way the system and fairly throughtforward is the water cleaner than when it came in .
The system is so healthy that the water .
So it &apos;s not just a vulnerous animals , not just a matter , not just a vulnerable to the health of his predatory , but a matter that literally , but a matter that literally , the literally water sination installation .
And not just for that fish , but also for you and miles .
that if the water flows away , it &apos;s in the Atlantic .
A drop in the ocean , I know what , but I &apos;m going to take , and that would also have to kill you because this love high-display , even though romism , is teacher .
You can say it &apos;s a recipe for the present of good , whether we &apos;re wearing about bag .
Now , what we need is a radial new agricultural conceptomobile .
But for a lot of people is that a little bit of too radicaal .
We &apos;re not realistic , we are fine .
We are love .
We love the market tall .
We love little families .
We &apos;re just talking about locally .
We eat organ .
And if you suggesting that these are the things that are the empathy of good empathy , there &apos;s always a church , I love rock out of rock , but how do you go the world nuggle , but how are you going to feed the world ?
How are you going to go into the world .
Can I honest ?
I don &apos;t love that problem .
Neasy because we are now produce more than enough calories to feed the world .
And one of them leads today &apos;s hungry .
And one of them , that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of the great inequality in department , not the amount .
I don &apos;t like this question , because she &apos;s the logic of the logic of our system for the last 50 years .
Foor grain grain , pesticide , pesticides to monocultural , chemicals to fish , chemicals , and the entire agricultural to be more people , and the entire agricultural footage to be more people , how to be that as single as much as much as it is to be as sitting .
That &apos;s the motivation .
It &apos;s the justified .
It &apos;s been the entrepreneur of American agriculture .
We ought to empowered it , an enterprise in liquidation , an enterprise of ecological capital , which that production is right .
That &apos;s not a support , and it &apos;s not an agriculum .
And our daily bread is now threatency , not by detectory , but because of the source of source , not by the latest combined , but by fertilized rums , but by fertilyfish , not by clean water , but not by clean .
Do you want the world to nurture ?
Let &apos;s start with the questions , how do we get ourselves ?
Now , how can we conditions of conditions in which every single exercise can make themselves ?
To do that , don &apos;t look at the agries of the future .
It &apos;s old and it &apos;s cold .
It &apos;s reading strong , chemicals and machines and machines, and it &apos;s never really good enough to eat .
So , instead of looking at the ecological model .
That &apos;s the model that trust on two empath-job of experiencing .
Look at Miguel, like Miguel, like Miguel, who don &apos;t know their own worldding , which repaintings re-growing , intensive that extensive extensive of extensive that extensive , but intensive , experts in relatively because they are the experts in relatively , because they are the experts in relationship .
And if I very , very honest , they &apos;re a better cock than I will ever be .
You know , I think it &apos;s primary , because if that &apos;s a major issue of issue , it gets .
Thank you .
I grew up , at a constant diet of a fiction .
At educational education , I went with the bus to school , I went back to school with the bus , every day .
And I was always absorbed by a book , a very fiction book , which involved me in thoughts of other worldate and date , in the middating sense , my invitable news .
En, knows that &apos;s curiosity , who &apos;s curiosity in the fact that I don &apos;t washing in school , when I don &apos;t washing in school , I wash in the forest , snails and emphasized , snails , inslanguage , insnails and five water , and they took them back into the aware of the case cope .
You know , I was a real scientific science .
But it was all about understanding the world , the limits of the potential understanding .
And miracle of love for having to be mirently mirror in the world for me , because what happened was , this was the end of the satisfer , we went to the months , we went to the monthly ocean to the exploring , Jacques Cousteau came to the exploring , Jacquiefs our animals and have a wonderful world , which we can &apos;t really see our animals and places and a wonderful world that we had never been able .
This seemed to resonate with the wild element of it .
And I was an artists .
I could draw . I could draw .
And because there were no games of games , and these collection of CG , and all this kind of an alandscape of the malandscape .
You know what , we needed to do , as kids , as a children are reading and description of the author something on the filming of the author in our heads .
And my reaction about this : painting , painting , drawing , aliens , aliens , aliens , aliens , robotic creatures , all that kind of dinner .
I became constantly traps mathematics sitting behind mathematics .
That was the creativity that was an extraordinary .
And then something interesting happened about the Jacques Cousteau program , made me very excited about the fact that there was a very excited about the fact that there &apos;s an alien world washed here on Earth .
I wouldn &apos;t really go to an alien world on a day in a spacecraft .
That seemed to be an unlikely .
But that was a world where I could actually employed to actually go here on Earth , which is so rich and exotic washing , if everything that I had imagined me through the reading of that books .
So , I decided to become subjects of year-old .
And the only problem with that washing , I was a small village in Canada living in Canada , 600 miles of the nearest ocean .
But that &apos;s not what I showed .
I saw in messages , until he finally found a disease school in Buffalo, New York , just about the borders of where we lived .
And I took a minute of a certification in a swim of a YMCA, in middle , New York .
And I think of the ocean , a real ocean , not until two years ago , when we moved to California .
Since servannouncing in the garden ligent , I &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under water , and 500 hours of that was in submarine .
And I &apos;ve learned that that deep sea , and even the undeep ocean , and even the undeep ocean with wonderful life .
The disconnect of nature is so limited to our constraints , compared to our limitation ,
Until this lady , I &apos;ve got great for what I see when I &apos;m seeing these days .
And malizing love for the ocean is just as strong as they ever washing as much as strong as they ever washing .
But when I adult as adult a career , this was filmmaker .
And that seemed the best of it , to combine the drop I had to combine stories with my drink to tellent stories .
And as a kid , I was always doing the drawings of comic books , etc .
Films make the way to make sense of meaning and stories together . And that seemed .
And the extraordinary of the excellength , except for it .
And with The Abysses , I spent The Abysses , I brought in front of water and collaboratory with films .
Say for two passions , the two passions .
Something interesting about the empathy from the Abysses , which is to solve a particular technical problem in that movie , the messages of a liquid water , that we have a generated water -- that computer generated animation of a liquid water , CG, surrounds .
And this result in the first software surrounded surfacing , CG , who ever had in a movie .
And even though that the movie never brought , it was nauditory for a moment , I &apos;ve got to say , I was garden gorgeous public , that was the public , the public , the public , showed the public magic .
You know what , the empathor Clark of wells , that every single separated technology is not too distinct of magic .
They saw something magic .
And I became very excited .
And I thought , this is something that needs to become something that needs to be surrounded in the movie .
Bush , with a terminal means of my view , we &apos;re going to have a lot of introduce .
World argument ILMs , we empowered the liquid metals in that movie . The success that would work .
And that &apos;s what we did . And we remember ,
And we had a result of the public .
We have a little bit more money on that movie .
Bush , to bring a line between those two points of experiencing , totally this becomes a whole new global , a whole new world of creativity .
So I started a company with Stan Winstoning , my good friend Stan Winstonish-up-up-up designer and creatures at that time , and it was a genmital Domainitial Domainitial Domainitial Domainitial Domainitial Domain .
And the concept of the business was that we would be master for the analog processes of optical printers and so on digital production .
And that &apos;s what we actually did , and the gave us a competition .
But we found ourselves in the middle in the middle of the 1990s , in the creatures and character design , for which we originally had focused on the business .
So , I wrote this piece of called Avatory of Avatory , that was to supposed to explain the boundaries of visual effects , of realistic human event , realistic human beings in CG . And the world would be the main CG . And the world would be in CG . And the world would be in CG would be the boundaries .
And I was told by the people in mutaneously , that we wouldn &apos;t be able to do this .
So I put it in the refrigerator , and I made that other film about a big ship that sink .
And I sold it to the studio alsize of the realm of Romeo and Juuliety for a chickness .
It becomes an epic romism , passionate movie .
And what I wanted to do was washing , I wanted to do what I wanted to do is to be recognized .
And that &apos;s why I make the movie .
And that &apos;s the truth . Echer , the studio knew ,
But I convinced hengine . I &apos;m going to make sense . We &apos;re going to get it .
We will use it in opening the film .
It &apos;s going to be very important . It &apos;s going to be a great deal of realm .
I convinced them an expedition .
Sounds sound . But this comes back at the theme of your imagination that a reality of the reality .
That &apos;s really a reality that we really reality is a reality of a Russian submarine supply , two and a half a mile depth , in the northern Atlantic , looking at the northern Atlantic ocean , not a movie , not a movie , not HD, but right .
Now , I got to represent .
And the most engineering a bunch of emergence , we had to develop and all kinds of dinner .
But it looked at how much these diverse , these deep tells on spacecraft .
You know , it was very technical and the most enormous planning .
You step into this dark capsule , your dark in these dark environment that there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t go back on yourself .
And I thought , well , it &apos;s kind of Wown , it &apos;s kind of a fiction movie .
This is very copyright .
And I had the taste of the realm of the deep ocean ,
Nature , the curiosity of curiosity , the science component .
It was the bottom . It was an adventure . It was an imagination . And it was an experience that was an experience that Hollywood .
Take a datast , I was able to realize a visual effectively . But I couldn &apos;t realize what I was going to do .
As we deal with some of our next expeditions , I think of all of our next expeditions , and sometimes things that I had never been seen before , sometimes things that I had ever seen before that I had ever seen before , the realization of the science of the time we saw them , and they had them .
So I was fulfilled by this and more deaths .
And so I made a little more strange decision .
After the success of Titancient Titancient , I said , I think , as I &apos;m going to realize a while , and I &apos;m going to take a while at the time .
And so we started planning these expeditions .
And we finally went to the Bismarket , and exploration with robotic vehicle .
We went back to the Titanicycle .
We took little boately tiny challenge that we had glassed with glass .
And the idea was to go in and go into an inter-investigate , which was never done before .
No one had ever been in the wrap . They didn &apos;t have the resources to door , so we developed technology to do it .
Bush here , I &apos;m zero-on the deck of the Titanic, and look out at the bottom , and look outside out to plant a lot of things like deseem that I knew the band played .
And I got a little robot vehicle through the process of the ship .
And when I say , I say that I collect him , but mortaneously , I felt as though I was physically felt like I was physically in the creation of the Titanicans .
And it was the most sural species that I &apos;ve ever been hatching experience , because I had ever been hatching for the lights of the vehicle for the lights of the vehicle of the vehicle , because I had a few months at the time when we make the movie to the movie .
And the set was like an exactly replica on the blueprint of the ship .
So it was an absolutely remarkable experience .
And it made me realizing that the telepresence of the tele-realizing that you can realize this kind of a robotic advental attaches in the vehicle of the vehicle .
It was really deeply profound .
And maybe a little bit of a look at what could happen , which is decades decades , as a cyboard for exploration or involved in many kinds of purpose , in many kinds of purpose , I can imagine , as a fiction as a fiction .
Bush , these expeditions have done , and really , starting to appreciate what there is washing down there , like the deep ocean resources , where we &apos;re wonderful mirabilous animals .
And they &apos;re just practical beings just here on Earth .
They live in a environment of chemosynthesea .
They don &apos;t live in a sunlight based as we do .
And so you see animals that live next to 500 degrees of Celcius head .
You might think that they could be impossible .
I was also going to remember very interested in in space science , again , again , as a fiction of fiction influence as a child .
And I became involved in the spacecraft , very involved at NASA , for near the NASA &apos;s deavestial , the reality of plannal space missions , I went to Russions to the pre-cular protocools and all that sort of dinner to the international space station to the international space station with our 3D camera on our 3D camertestation .
And this was fascinating .
But what the final result is washing , which I think I think of the scientists with our munam to the depth .
And they empathy so that they had already been interested in planetary scientists , people who were interested in those extreme environmental environmental , they go down to the sources and take samples and bring them to look at the sources , and so on .
Bush , there were a documentary films of the documentary of the documentary of the documental science .
And I had the circle of the argument , you know wealthy , as a child and all of this .
And I learned this journey of discovery , I learned a hope .
I learned a lot about scientific . But I learned a lot about leadership .
Now , you should think that a director should be a leader leader , leader from the ship and that kind of business .
I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership to me until I decided that expeditions .
Actually , I think of a view of meaning : What do I do this ?
Why am I going to do it ? What I &apos;m going to do I think of it .
We don &apos;t deserve money with this disappeared programming .
They &apos;re naugmentation . It &apos;s not to expressure .
People think that I &apos;ve gone to be gone by Titanickly , and I &apos;m going to realize that I &apos;m going to turn around , somewhere on the beach .
I made all of these filmmassive , all these documentary documentary .
No famous , no glory , no glory . What are you doing ?
You do it for the work , for the challenging , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that there , for the exciting of the exciting , and for those strange band that exist as a small group of people a team .
That &apos;s what we did for all of these things with extremely 12 people for years .
Sometimes at the sea for 2-3 makes a piece .
And by that band-, you realize that the most important thing is that you &apos;ve got respect for them and say before you have a task , that you can &apos;t explain a task , which you can &apos;t explain to somebody .
When you get back to wake , and you know , we had to do this , and we had to do this and the fiber fiber , and the date it , and the date , all the massive of the massive property of the works on sea , that you can &apos;t explain it . It is that what police poligives or people in the agent , and they know that they can never know it .
And that &apos;s a band-a-respectacular respectable .
So when I came back to massive , which is what Avatory of Avatory , I was trying to figure out the same principle of leader , which is that you respecting your team to respecting your team .
And that really changed the dynamics .
Dush , there I was a small teams of a tiny teams , I wasn &apos;t exist for the macognition , new technology that hasn &apos;t existed before .
Enorm exciting .
Enorm challenge .
And we have a family , for four and a half announcement .
And it turns out how I make films .
Dush , people gave comment on how to say , the ocean organisms , the ocean organisms back to the planet Pandora .
For me , it was more a fundamental way of the process of the process of the process of that .
Dush , what can we synthesizes ?
You know , what are the learned ?
Nold , I think number is a curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing you existing .
Image of image is a reality of a reality can be a reality .
And the respect of your team is more important than all the lecture in the world .
And there are young filmmakers who come to me and say , &quot; Gength : Taking me a little bit of advice to dozen .
And I &apos;m going to say , &quot; Don &apos;t exist themselves .
Otherwise people are going to do for your dodo , don &apos;t mind themselves .
And take risk of risk .
NASA has this sad where they crazy crazy .
But failure has to be an option in art and discovering , because it &apos;s a sense of deep in the deep issue .
And not a major entrequires that requires has been done without risk .
You have to be willing to be willing those risks .
And that &apos;s the thought I &apos;d like you want to latent behind that in whatever your towel , failure , but fear . Thank you .
Now , if I can tell you one big idea today , it &apos;s that it &apos;s very much more of the data that we use , is larger than the sum of the deletal .
Instead of talking about exploring information , I want to think about how we can use information to pull patterns and the trends that would stay invisible .
This is a typical death involved to age .
The tool I use here is an experimental experimental experimentally .
It &apos;s called Pivoted by Pivoted , I can filter on one of the death , for instance .
I see immediately a different pattern .
That &apos;s because here in the middle people in the middle of the people most active .
We can reorganize outside and reorganizing the data and reorganizing the data .
We see that heart disease and cancer the usual challenge , but not for every single one .
And when we &apos;re going to be , for instance , for instance , for example , or young , we &apos;re seeing the biggest cause of sentence .
If you dive that deeper there , for male for male .
And you can see what I mean is looking at information this way of seeing information in a living information .
If we can do this with rough , why don &apos;t we do it with content ?
What we greeted here is the front page of every single number of Spports Ilustrated that ever made .
Everything state . It &apos;s all about this .
You can go to your room and try this after my talks .
With Pific , you can get on a decade .
You can zoom in a last year .
You can go to a song number song .
I &apos;m looking at this damn . I see the athletes that are different in this number , the sports .
I &apos;m fan from Lance of mstrong-empathy , so I &apos;m going to get up , and that gives me all the number of the number .
And if I just want to look at this thing , I think , why don &apos;t you know , I think , &quot; Why not all the realm of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of examples .
I do a step back and go on that .
Now I see Greg Greg Lemond .
And you can see that if you launching information , teller and broad , and then you go out , you don &apos;t leave anything .
You do something else that a little different issue .
It &apos;s sitting there , and we think it changes how you can use information .
So I want to figure out a little bit , a little bit crazy .
Here we &apos;ve taken every page of Wikipedia , and it &apos;s limited to a little covering .
The summarization is a small synthesis and a icology to be an icoon .
I just show you the top 500 popular Wikipedia page .
But even in this limited , we can see a lot .
We get immediately an idea of the topics that are the popular on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to check government .
Now I got government government , I see the Wikipedia categories that categories down there , Time , Time Mengine People .
This is very important because this view in no one of the aparte Wikipedia pages satch .
You can only get it through a step backwards , and you can see them all .
And if I look at one of these consummarizations , I can look deeper on the understanding Time Persis from the year .
A happiness of all these people learn to me that the majority of the politics .
Some people come out of natural science .
One more smaller number comes out of business .
is my business .
One is coming from the music global .
What &apos;s interesting isn &apos;t a TED Prize .
So , we can represent to all TED Prize .
So , we navigate for the first time by the web as if it &apos;s really a web , not from page to page , but it &apos;s a higher abstrategy .
I want to show you one other thing to show you a little bit more amazing .
I &apos;m going to show you the website of the New empathy .
Pivot, this application -- I don &apos;t want to be a browser , it &apos;s not a browser , but you can see a web pages of it -- we bring these sized technology to every web page , and so on .
I &apos;m going to take a step back and return , right in a specific section .
And the reason this important is that I think , is that I &apos;m just looking at web pages to watch my whole browse history in the meaning .
I can go deeper in what I &apos;ve been doing is for the period .
Here &apos;s the status of the demo that I just felt .
And I can play some of the things that I can play earlier today .
If I put a step back and look everything , I can look at my histories , I could sell my historic selling .
And so here I did some nepotist research , and I was looking for Labs , and here &apos;s except Labs Pivoted .
From there , I can get deeper on the page and it again .
It &apos;s one metaphor that re-metaphor , it makes it very larger than the sum of the parts of the data .
On our world , in our world , we see data as a liquid .
We &apos;re talking about the fluences of information .
We &apos;re talking about drowning .
Now , if we could take that on his head , and the Web at its head , so that rather than to go from one thing to the next one thing to the following , we can reference from many things to many things to many things , and the patterns that could see the patterns that otherwise would be hidden .
If we &apos;re at that art , we &apos;re not stuck in datast , we might really be information .
Instead of just working with information , we can perhaps knowledge .
If we have a knowledge , maybe even wisdom to find wisdom .
So , thank you very much .
Everybody speaks today about happiness .
I &apos;ve got somebody to count the number of books that the youngest five years with sound of the title , and he has given up in about 40s , and there were a lot more .
There &apos;s lots of lots of lucky in research .
There &apos;s a lot of happiness .
Everybody wants to make people happier .
But despite the measures that mass of masses are different cognitive values that make it impossible to think about justice .
And I &apos;m going to talk about today about that cognitive values today .
This is true for ordinary people who took about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for researchers , because it turns out that we &apos;re just as in the war as the other one .
The first currency is the squarity to be complexity .
It turns out that the word happiness is not a useful word is because we it on too many things .
And I think there &apos;s one of the meaning that we might have to construggling it , but everything is considered to be something that we &apos;re going to have to give up the more complicated vision of what practice .
The deaths is the confusion between experience and memory : that comes down in the difference between your life and your lifetime and happy are about your life or your lifetime or happy with your life .
And that &apos;s two totally different things that are being thrown in one hope in the concept for sound .
And the third values is the illusion of focus and the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a circumstances that impact has impact on our wellent without the importance .
I mean , this is really a cognitive values .
There &apos;s no extremely a way to get this .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who &apos;s been asking for a while and answer after one of my meeting a story .
And this was nice .
He said he had listening to a symphony , and that it was absolutely fantastic music , and at the end of the extremely extremely sure such sound .
And then , really motivity , really motival engineering the whole experience .
But that climbing .
It had the rememories to the experience .
He had the experience .
He had 20 minutes fantastic music .
And they were nothing more worthy because he was a remembering ; the remember was department , and the remind was already what he had to do .
And what this brings us to us is that we could see ourselves and others as two and others .
There &apos;s an experiencing , which is living in the presents and knowledge , which is able to reinforced the past the past the past .
The doctor focused to our experiencing -- if the doctor asking , you know , if the doctor asks the pain as I &apos;m touching you here to touch of mind .
And then there &apos;s the remindset , and I remembering , and I &apos;m the one that holds and the story of our lives , and that &apos;s the story of our lives , and that &apos;s the deathroughout the memory of how you are the last time sensitivity for the last time , you know , the aware of the mind .
or a sense of the journey of the journey , or sweet .
And that &apos;s two very different dinner , I experiencing and it remembering and the confusion between them is both part of the cooky that &apos;s made of the understanding happiness .
It I remember is a telling .
And that really begins with a fundamental response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
We &apos;re not only telling stories when we make us to tell stories .
Our memmemory is tells us that wants to say , which is what we can exist of our experiences is a story .
And let me show with one example .
This is an old research .
Those are real meaning .
I &apos;m talking to you the detail . This is not painful today , but it was painful when this research walked in the 1990s .
They had to rest every 60 seconds about their pain report .
And these are two feet .
These are their addict .
And it gets to be asked by the purposes of them .
And that &apos;s a very easy problem .
It &apos;s obviously that allows has gotten more pain .
His colonuses longer sustained longer , and for every minute pain that &apos;s A has had gotten mulnerous for one of them , and messages .
But here &apos;s another questioning : How many pain thinking that they &apos;ve taken this aware of welling ?
And what a surprise : The surprise is that the resource is a much more bad remember rememory of the Cology .
The stories of the colonoscopies differently , because a very important part of the story is a very important part of the waste -- and no one of these stories is extremely invent or choice -- but one of them is just one of them .
And the ergal story is the pain the end .
That &apos;s a quality .
How do we know ? How do we know that ? We know these people asked their colonoscopy , and a lot of teacher , and a lot of teacher .
and it was much worse for A than for B, in their memories .
Well , this is a justice of conflict between the experiencing and the frogs .
From the point of view of the experiencing I &apos;ve got the clear public .
Well , what you could do with the empathy of A, and we actually have clinical trials , and that &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s employ the collaborator of the collaborator of the business of having the business of the business of it .
That causes the empathy of suffering , but not field , and much less than before .
And if you hold that a few minutes , you have the experiencing of the memorize A , and you &apos;ve got it to remember , and you &apos;ve got it to remember because of the memory of his experiences now have a better story about his experience .
What &apos;s a story ?
And that &apos;s true for the stories of the memory us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we collect .
What a story of majority is changing important moments and end .
Einds are the universe , very important and in this case was the end .
Well , the experiencing I live his life .
It &apos;s got moments of experiencing , one after the other .
And you know , what happens to this moment ?
And the answer is really simple .
They &apos;re always lorrecently .
I mean , the present moments of our lives -- I have the extremely for three minutes , it &apos;s about three minute says about three minutes .
That meaning , you know , in a life , you have about 600 million .
In a month , there are about 60,000,000,000,0000,000,000,000,0000,0000,000,000,0000,00000,000,000,000,00,000,00,00,00,00,000,000,000,0000,00,00,0
It doesn &apos;t make any traces .
At the present is not spent attention by remember .
And in one way or other way , the impression that they ought to be from the telling these experiencing moments our lives .
It &apos;s the end commodity that we use for employee .
And how you relevant to be relevant , but so that the story is not that relevant to us .
So we remember the thing I and the experiencing , and that are really different disappearing .
The biggest difference between both lies in the area of time .
From the point of view of the experiencing I have a vacation , and it &apos;s just as good as the first thing as the vacation of two weeks as well as the vacation of one week .
It doesn &apos;t work for remember .
For the memorizing I is a vacation of two weeks better than the vacation of one week because there &apos;s no new memories are added .
You don &apos;t have the story .
And in that way , is , in that way , the mind is actually a remember of an experiencing .
Time has very few impact on this .
I remembering more than remembering and stories .
It &apos;s the except that decisions takes dealt , if you &apos;ve got disease , say , two colonologies of surgeons and have to decide which he has to decide which he &apos;s going to choose any of the least remember , and that is the surgeon .
The experiencing I don &apos;t have voice in this kitchen .
We don &apos;t choose between experience .
We choose between rememories of experiencing . And even if we don &apos;t think about the memories we don &apos;t normally think about our member .
We think of our extremely as a member remember .
And you can actually look at this as a dictatory , as a dictature of the memory , and you can remember it the experiences that I did not remember the experiences that I don &apos;t need it experiences that the powerful I don &apos;t need the feeling , I feel that if we &apos;re going to go with vaction the biggeous to the largest part of our brainner .
And that &apos;s pretty hard to think responsible .
I mean , how often use our member ingene ?
That &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s been given for the dominance of remember .
And when I think about that I think about a vacation that we had a couple of years ago in Antarctica , clearly our best vacation ever washing , and I think of it in compared to other vaccess .
And I have a memories of my rememories for three weeks about 25 minutes the last four yarency .
Nuth , if I had opened the map of the 600 photograph of it , I would spend an hour .
So that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s almost anti-and-a-half .
There &apos;s an argument .
Numental , maybe I &apos;m a little extremely known , in the limited hunger that I have to rememories , but even if you &apos;re familiar to rememory , why do we have so much more interestingly to remember the interest with the importance that we have so much of experiencing towards the importance that we &apos;re considered to experience the importance that we &apos;ve got so much of experiencing acknowledge ,
So I want you to think about a thought experimental experimentation .
Imagine on your next vacation knows that at the end of the vacation is going to be destroyed to be destroyed to the memory of the memory so you don &apos;t rememory anything more .
Would you choose a vacation ? And if you choose another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between you .
and you have to think about how you conflict conflict .
That &apos;s not as for granted , because if you think of time in terms of time you get a single answer .
And if you think in terms of memories , you may have another answers .
Why we choose the vactions that we choose confront of our confront of choice .
Number two leading to two notes of happiness .
There are really two forms of happiness that we can applications , one .
So you can suggest , how happy is the experiencing ?
And then , would you know , how happy are the moments in life of the experiencing ?
And they &apos;re all -- the happiness of moments is a pretty complicated processes .
What are the empaign ?
Brens, today we are able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of experiencing the time .
If you ask the happiness of the member I is that a total other seed .
This is not about how happy somebody lived .
It &apos;s about how happen or following the meaning of having its life .
Total different conceptable .
Everybody who these concepts in one hope will make a coot of the study of the happiness , and I think of the lucky for a group of the study for a long time of the study of the happiness of the study of the study of the happiness of the study of the happiness of the study of happiness ,
The distinction between the happiness of experiencing and the sufficiency of remember , and there are attempts to realize the two separate separate , the Gallup Organization is a global for more than half million people have asked about what they think about their lives and their experiencing .
And there &apos;s more efforts in that sense .
So the young years , we &apos;re starting to produce the happiness of the two .
And the most important lesson we &apos;ve gone , think , is that they &apos;re really different from each other .
You can know how teach someone with his life is , and that telling you how happy he learn about how happy he led his life .
Just to give you an idea of the correlation , the correlation is about 0,500 .
That means that if you ought to meet somebody , you would say his father to meet you know that his length , how much would you know about his length ?
You would know something about his length , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
Now , a lot of uncertainty , you would have a lot of uncertainty of uncertainty , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are about their experiencing .
So the correlationship is weaky .
We know something about what the significant peace of experiencing me .
We know that money is very important , goals are very important .
We know that happiness means that happiness means that we &apos;re satisfied with people we mogene .
There are other pleasant , but this weights .
So , if you &apos;re lucky to maximize the two , it will turn out that you &apos;re very different things .
The conclusion of what I said here is that we really wouldn &apos;t considered as a substitute for well-being .
It &apos;s a very different conceptable conceptable .
And then very , very , very , a different reason why we don &apos;t think about happiness is that we can &apos;t think about the meaning , and if we &apos;re effectively about life .
So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people in California , you won &apos;t get the right answer .
If you ask that question , you think people have to be happier in California , if you &apos;re going to get in California .
And what happens when you think about life in California , you think about the contrast between California and other places , and that contrast is in the climate .
It turns out that the climate doesn &apos;t matter so important for the experiencing I , and not even the thinking about how happy people .
But because it &apos;s the way I think of the boss it can turn out that you -- that somehow move to California .
And it &apos;s kind of interesting to go to what &apos;s going to happen to people who moved to California lot of happier .
Well , their experiencing themselves will not happier .
That know .
But one thing happens . They think they &apos;ll be happier , because if they think about it will be reminded , because if they think about it was reminded how terrible it was in Ohio .
And they &apos;ll think that they &apos;re going to have the right decision .
It &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and I hope that I &apos;ve given you a sense of how fashion .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for youth .
Very much .
When we were in a couple of weeks ago , you told me that there was a very interesting finding me that there was a very interesting finding Galling .
Can you resource this with us a few minutes about greeing ?
Daniel Kahneman: Sure I think the most interesting result in the Galling pollution is a number we didn &apos;t have absolutely expected .
It has to do with the happiness of experiencing .
If we look at how feelings we look at the income .
It turns out that under the revenues of 60,000 dollars a year for Americans , and then it &apos;s all over a whole big group of Americans , about 60,000,000,0000,0000,00000,000 dollars a year ...
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars per announced , and they become more happier .
and above that we see a full flat .
I mean , I ended rarely such lines .
It &apos;s obvious , what happens is that money you don &apos;t bring your argument happiness , but that &apos;s a lack of money , and we can measuring those miserable measure with case , very large precise .
For the other ikness , you remember a very different thing .
And the more money you &apos;re going to get the more following you .
That &apos;s not true for the present .
CA: But Danny, the entire American striped for life , and the pursuit of happiness .
As people who are taking results seriously than anything to do is to make sure everything that we believe , say , maar, since policy policy , and sweet .
an opportunity that the country would take the general result in a such result , and the public public public public public public policies .
DKemeaning , I think there &apos;s recognition of happiness in public policy research .
That recognition is going to be slow in the United States , which is not doubt , but in the United Kingdom , and in other countries .
People it should be thinking about happiness when they think about public policy .
It &apos;s going to take a time and people will debate about whether they want to debate happiness or the evaluation of life or the evaluation of life .
How we &apos;re lucky lucky depending on how you think and whether you think about the memorizing I or the experiencing .
This is going to influenced the policies in the next few years .
In the United States , in the United States are exciting happiness of population .
I think that &apos;s going to talk about a year or 20 of the national statistics .
CA: Wel, the exciting thing that this subject is the most interesting policy policy problem for the next few years or should be to follow for the next few years .
Thank you so much for your invention of the havioral economics .
Thank you , Danny Kahnemane .
I &apos;m going to talk about today and climate .
And perhaps a little bit of surprisingly , because my wellular time is about variety and business , about the things that we need to invent and suffering the poorest two of the poorest of people .
But energy and climate are extremely important for this human beings , in fact , more importantly than simply for this planetary .
The climate collects so that their crops will not grow growing .
There will be too many rain , or too religion .
Things will change their vulnerable , so that their vulnerable environmently .
And that leads to hungry . It leads to uncertainty . It leads to insecurity .
So the climate change will be a disaster for them .
The price of energy is extremely important for hengage .
In features , if you could choose one thing to do is , to reduce the poverty of poverty .
The energy price is silent to the dalene .
Every , very advanced civilization is based on the front of energy .
The carbon revolution lead to the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , and even in the twentieth century , and therefore we have coalaxy , airconditional conditional , we can make malaxy of modern things .
And so we have a wonderful situation with electricity in the world .
And now , we make the cheap -- and let &apos;s make it twice as cheap -- then there &apos;s a new limiting , and it has to do with CO2 .
CO2 leads to heat from the planette , and the equation of CO2 is actually a very extremely .
And if you count the CO2 that gets out , the CO2 , which leads to a temperature , and that temperature leads to some very negative effects .
The effects of the weather , perhaps the indirect effects , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to this , and so you get ecosystems that collapse .
Number exactly amount of how to make sure from CO2 to what temperature is going to go to what temperature is going to go , and where the positive back , is about that is the only uncertainty , but not very field .
And there is no extremely about how much the consequences are going to be , but they will be very serious .
I &apos;ve often asked this to top-science .
we really need to get out of nability ?
Can &apos;t we have half or a quarter ?
And the answer is date , until we stay in the neighborhood , the temperature will stay .
And so that &apos;s a big challenging .
It &apos;s very different from , for example , a very high trucks under a 3.6 of trucks , which is trying to get out of it .
This is something to zero .
Number a lot of CO2 , more than 26 examples .
For every American , this is about 20 .
For people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one .
It &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
And we encourage , how to change things to zero .
It &apos;s constantly environmental .
It &apos;s just a little economic changes , so we need to have a dectory , so we have to have from a measures to zero-sum measured to zero-sum for zero-sum .
This equation has four facilities .
A little bit collection .
CO2 , you have something about the left officer , CO2 , which is based on the left , and that &apos;s based on the number of human , the average use of services per personal , the average use of services per person , and the CO2 , the CO2 , and the CO2 .
Bush , let &apos;s look at this piece for piece and see how we can get this to zero .
Probably to one of these values in the neighborhood .
That &apos;s high school mathematics , but let &apos;s take a look at .
First of all , we have the population .
Number the world today has 6.8 eight in mental today .
That is to the rise to roughout the nine of nine .
Duses , if we do it really well with new various health care , healthcare , reproductive health productive healthcare , then we could reduce that metable , missions we can see a little bit of about 1,300 .
The massive factor is the services that we use .
This instead , the realm that we &apos;re clothes , clothes , heat , heat .
These are very good dinnership , and it away from poverty means to almost everybody on the planet .
So it &apos;s amazing as this number .
In the rich global , perhaps the summit of the world , we can sutences , and the massive extremely , on average , on average , and the supply , in total-average , the services are going to be more than double than double .
Here we have a very extremely service .
Have your lighting into your lighting your lighting your lights , the fact , these children go outside and reading their homework .
Bush , efficient , E, the energy for every services .
Actually we have good news .
We have something that isn &apos;t rise .
Those invention and new invention of religent , through other species of autools , other species of construction .
There are a lot of services where you can reduce the energy that &apos;s wildlife .
Some of the services of the service , even at 90 .
There are other services , as how we produce measures or how we produce with air airs , where we have a lot of smaller .
And damn , if we &apos;re number , we can have a factor three to self-circular factor .
But for these first three factors , we &apos;ve gone of 26 empathy , and that &apos;s just not pleasant .
So , let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a paling -- and that &apos;s the CO2 emphasized .
So the question , can you get that to zero ?
If you stop coal , needle .
You know , you know , you know , needge .
Again , any way , we have electricity producer today , except for the emerging expensive energy and nuclear energy , CO2 .
And so what we need to do is a new system of global scale .
So we invited wildlife .
Duses , when I used the term of wonder , I &apos;m not going to go to something that impossible .
The processor is a mirroprocessor is a wonder .
The Internet and his services are a wonderful .
Duses , the people have contributed to a lot of wonder .
And Normaliter , we don &apos;t have a deadlinear , when you have to afford the date .
Most of you just wait out , and sometimes it happens , sometimes .
This is a case where we &apos;re actually going to have to full of the measures and have to get within a punishment days .
Now , how do I think , how can I do this ?
It &apos;s a kind of natural illustrategy , a demonstration that humans to the imagination ?
I was thinking back to a year ago when I mosquitoes , and I found it in a way or other way .
It actually made it involved in the idea that there are people who are lifetime with mosquitos .
Bus, with energy , this was the only thing I could do .
And I decided to leave front of my contribute to the environment here .
So here we have some natural fireflight here .
And I &apos;m telling that they don &apos;t leave pretty much , they may not even leave this potential .
Dush , there are all kinds of gimmunders like diempathy , but they don &apos;t really do something .
We have invitable to invitable , in an incredible scale and of an incredible scale and of an incredible contribute , although people in many directions , I see there are actually the empathy contribution .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing is , geothermal energymic energy , biofuel , biofuels .
Those perhaps a little bit , and if they do it better than I expected , is that the most important point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we don &apos;t get to sit , because it &apos;s incredible , because they all have their own important , because they all have their own important .
Let &apos;s do first look at fossil fuels , either burn for fossil fuels .
What you &apos;ve got to downtowards it , but that &apos;s nothing .
You &apos;ve got to take all the CO2 after the burning burning , under pressure , more liquid , liquid and hope that it makes it continued there .
Now , there &apos;s a number of prossibly providing this on the level of 60 to 80 percent , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult and determine where we have to have all that CO2 is very difficult , but the most difficult here is the long-term problem .
Who &apos;s going to this for science ?
Who will be there for a garant for something that literally exist of the argumen is bigger than any species of nuclear or other dinner ?
This is a huge volume .
So that &apos;s going to be difficult .
The next is nuclear energy .
There are three big problems .
The cost of the regulately landscene , are high .
And the issue of the security , really , that nothing can wrong , in fact , nothing wrong , in fact , if you have the except for nuclear weapons of nuclear weapons .
And what do you do with the waste ?
Even though it &apos;s not so much , there are a lot of issues .
They have to feel good about it .
So three very difficult problems that perhaps extremely , and that must be employment .
The last three of the fifth of fif, I &apos;ve gone .
These are some people often the renewable resources .
And that -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t require a fuel distance .
One is that the density of the energy won through these technologies through these technologies are lower than that of an electricity scentral .
This is energieland-building , you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of miles , more than you need for a normality .
Also , these are intermitting burn .
The sun &apos;t seeing the entire lady , and not every day , and no white it &apos;s not any day .
And dune , if you &apos;re dependent from this fire , you also have to find a way to have energy at the time of the time that they &apos;re not available .
Bush we have big cost challenges .
We have transportation challenge .
For instance , that these energy source outside your country , you have not only the technology invited , but you &apos;ve got to do with the risk of the energy of thirds .
English problem .
And to make that visible , I &apos;ve looked at all the species of batteries that made out of batteries , for authority , for pocem , for business , for business , and compared that the amount of the amount of electric energy that the world , and what I found is that all the batteries we make less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
So we have a big breakthrough here , something which is a factor of a factor here is better than the approach we now .
It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
This is important when you &apos;re trying to get reliable source higher than 20 to 30 percent of what you used to use .
If you have 00-miracle , you &apos;ve invited a wonderful battery .
Number how are we going towards , what &apos;s the right approach ?
Actually , a Manhattan-to-meeting ? How can we know this employee ?
Nouth , we need a lot of companies that are about it .
In every single of them , at least hundred human beings .
And a lot of henching , you &apos;ll find . That &apos;s cheap .
And I think about this in the TED group , we have a lot of people who have this already .
Bill Gaware of various company called eSolar who &apos;s Solar that big thermal solar technologies .
From Khosla investing in dozens of companies are doing great things and interesting to support , and I try to support that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I supporting a business , perhaps nuclear power .
There are a number of innovations in nuclear energy , moduce , and fluid .
And there &apos;s been no realized for a very long time in this industry , so it &apos;s not so strange that there &apos;s good new .
The idea of Terra is date date , instead of a tinstead of a tiny bit uranium , which is U-235 , which we decided to use the 999percent of U-238th .
A little bit strange ideas .
Men has ever been talking about thoughts , but they could never realize what it would be like .
But by the way of the supercomputers can now , and hunt !
With the right thing .
And because you use the 999percent , reduce the cost enormous .
You even though it , and as a fuel , you can see all the survival of current reactors .
So , instead of concerned that new fuel , that &apos;s amazing !
It &apos;s a regulately the reaction . It &apos;s a map for a map .
And you can see in this animation , often the realization of this ande-Golfulness .
For the fuel , this is really display .
I have a picture of a place in Kentucycle .
This is nuclear waste , the 99 , where the 1percent of the published .
So it &apos;s called uranium .
That &apos;s enough for the United States for hundreds of years .
And in a very cheap seawater , you get into a seawater , you get fuel enough fuel for the entire planetary of the whole planetary .
Duser , there are a lot of challenges for the future , but it &apos;s an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of them .
So let &apos;s say , how do we measure ?
How to report our report of view ?
Let &apos;s first see where we need to come out , and then to the tusensory .
For 2050s , speaking a lot of people about 80-percent reduction .
And that it &apos;s really important to do that .
And that 20 percent is going to be through poor agricultural .
Hopefully we have clean and cementation .
Bush , to pull that 80-percent developed language , including countries like China , their electricity produce .
And the other introduce : Passisted technology in all the developed language , and we &apos;re going to introduce that elsewhere ?
That &apos;s super important .
That &apos;s a important measuring point for that report .
Duses , how to report it for 2020 ?
Nold , it needs to those two people .
We have to immediately improvements the empathy .
The less we putting out , the CO2 wordwide the CO2 wordwide temperature .
But in some sense , the degree of doing things that we have , by doing things that are not to realize the majority , or perhaps even less than the other majority , which is the piece of involution .
And these breakthroughout the measure , and we can measure that measure in terms of business , excellent things that are changed .
Here &apos;s a big number of books about written .
The realization of Al Goren Century , and the David McKay book , David McKay , for David .
They &apos;re really going to take it right and imagine a framework that can be practice in large lines , because we have to have a wire flat here .
There &apos;s a lot that together .
So this is a while .
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we inventing this technology .
If you gave me one wish for the next 50 years , I could choose the president , I could choose a president , I could choose a wish of wood , or I could choose something that &apos;s been invented with half the cost , without CO2 , this is the wish I would choose any CO2 , this is the wish .
This is the one with the biggest impact .
If we don &apos;t get this wish , the separation between the people who think about short term and run on a long term , between the United States and China , between the United States and Chinain between the United States and China , and mostly the lives of the lives that are going to be more .
Dush , what should we do ?
So , what I &apos;m going to ask you ?
We need to research for more funding .
If countries come together in places like Copenhagen , they don &apos;t have to just the CO2 .
They need to have this indicate agenda , and you &apos;ll be supposed to exist of the ridiculous challenge .
We &apos;ve been inviting market , CO2 promise , putting and handle , something that makes the cost visible .
We need to wear the message .
This dialogue needs to rational and understanding of the steps that the government .
This is a major transition , but I think we can know it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you . Now , I understand more about Terrapology -- I mean , I meant , the first place , can you give an idea of the investment of the investment ?
Bill Gates: All the software , the supercomputer , the supercomputer , all the big scientists , all the big scientists , which is the equal of millions of millions , and even though we have a time for the members of the reactor to be some of millions , then it will be the high in the hundreds of millions .
The tricky is the building of the experimental reacts , finding the regulatory of the regulatory , the site of the regulatory .
You have the first built , if you &apos;ve built the first , as this works like , it &apos;s just overclear , because the economy , the energy , the energy density , the energy density , so different from nuclear energy as we have that knowledge .
CA: And jail to understand it good , it &apos;s going to be building deep under the soil as a kind of vertical column of nuclear fuel to uranium , and then it starts to uranium , and then the process of the process and then the process of the bottom , and then it &apos;s the process of the farming side and then decline ?
BG: That &apos;s right . Today the reactor has to be converted , so you &apos;ve got to have a lot of people and a lot of the controls who can wrong in the controls that you have to open up and things like that .
That &apos;s not good .
Duses , if you have a very cheap resources that you can make 60 years -- I think about it as a background process -- and it doesn &apos;t have that complexity .
And it &apos;s just a fire , and it &apos;s a challenge , and then it &apos;s challenge .
CA: It &apos;s a nuclear realization problem .
BG: Ja. Nouth , what happens to the waste , you can sit down -- there &apos;s lots of less waste with this approach -- or you can actually realize it in a different and put it in a different and burn it .
And we &apos;re beginning to make the waste today , which is sitting in the reactor of the reactor .
That &apos;s our fuel to initially initially .
Dush , what was a problem from this reactors is actually what &apos;s going to be introduced in the uncertain , and you reduce the volume of dramatically dramatic by processional .
CA: But in your global conversations about these possibility , where is really interested in this possibly ?
BG: Nouth , we haven &apos;t been expanded to expressure , and there are empowering rules about everything that nuclear is nuclear humans , so we enjoy interested in the business of the business of the business of the business of the business of the business of the business of all of the nuclear is .
And I &apos;ve got the state secretaris of energy about this , to be retaris about how this is the energy agencies .
So I &apos;m optimize . You know that the empathy and the Japanese --
This is a variant on something that &apos;s done .
It &apos;s a major step forward , but it &apos;s as a major reactor , and a lot of countries have built , so everyone who &apos;s been doing a potential candidate to build the first .
CA: Dus, in your minds , in your minds , and probability of something like this on the reality ?
BG: Nou, we &apos;ve got these electricity for these electricity things that we need to think very cheap things very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to think and then 20 years to implement .
That &apos;s a kind of term that the environmental models that we have to suffering .
En, knows , Terrapology , as well , what a lot of people &apos;s going to do that easy .
And there are now lucky business , we &apos;ve invited hundreds of indiempathy , long-research and their research as well as the financision for their professional installations , that they can compete with this .
And it &apos;s the best thing to do is , because then you can use a mix of this dingene .
We need at least one to bet .
CA: In terms of possible changes in largest scal, this is the biggest that you know ?
BG: An energy breakthrough , it &apos;s very important .
That would be , it would be , even without the environmental constration , but the environmental it makes so much large .
In the nuclear sector are also other innovators .
You know , it &apos;s not as good as a deseveral , but the modular human , that &apos;s a different approach .
There &apos;s a type of liquid reacts that a little bit difficult , but maybe they say that about us .
So there are different de, but the beauty of this is a uranium moleculation has a million times as much energy as a bvice moleculation , and such as you can deal with the negative effects in terms of the negative effects in terms of the footprint and the cost , in terms of effect on the country and the cost , in terms of effect on the country , in terms of effect on the land and different dinner .
CA : If this doesn &apos;t work ?
Do we start with the regular measuregulatory to try to try the temperature of the Earth ?
BG: If you &apos;re in those situation , the as if you competition , and at the point is to get a heart .
Where are you going to get a heart operation or something like that .
There &apos;s a line of research that &apos;s research that &apos;s extraordinary technologies that would slow down the heat which we would reduce our 20 or 30 years to engaging .
That &apos;s just a kind of resecurity .
You don &apos;t require that .
Some people say you don &apos;t even have to work on as a wildlife , because you know , you &apos;re going to keep on food because you know that there is a heart operation to be a heart surgery .
I don &apos;t know whether that distant , the importance of problem , but there &apos;s now the debate of the issue of the argument , that has to be a very slowly , or as the invational process of the realization is going to be a piece of slower than we expect .
CA: Klimate sculpture , if you could take a two sentences to them , how would you convincing them that they error from sitting them salong ?
BG: Nou, unfortunately the skeptics .
There are very little with scientific argument .
Does that there are negative feedback effects that have to do with the clouds that compensent things ?
There are very little things that they can still be able to opportunity , there &apos;s an opportunity of one million that up .
And the main problem we have is just like an AIDS .
You get the mistake , and you pay a lot more later .
And then , when you remember all kinds of problems , the idea now is to get the pain later , the pain order to get the benefit .
In fact , it describes the IPCC report not necessarily the worst scenario, and there are people in the rich world that are going from the IPCC and sagently , that falls all rather .
It should be that uncertainty that uncertainty of us that .
But my dream is date , if you can calculate the economic , and then following the CO2 , then the skeptics of the skeptics that there is no CO2 from coming out there , I would even wish that there was no CO2 from coming out of CO2 , but I wish it &apos;s going to be accepted , but I &apos;m accepting it because the challenge of it .
CA: And that would be your reaction on the argument of Bjorn Lomborg, which is that if you spend all of this energy at the end of the CO2 problems , which is going to try and try to resolve the world of poverty and malaria , and so on .
It &apos;s a dumb waste of aid resources to spend money there , if there are better things that we can do with it .
BG: Nouth , the actual spending for that Respecially , say that the United States must have been spended to spend more than now -- is not so dramatic .
It doesn &apos;t have to be having to other dinner .
It &apos;s really just in big amount of big amount of opinion that , when you have something that uneconomic , when you try something that uneconomic , trying to figure out .
That issues , usually , most of a waste .
And unless you &apos;re very close to you &apos;re very close to you &apos;re only financies , and it becomes very cheap .
I think we need to try and more things that potentially have to be much less expensive .
So , if it &apos;s going to get you to start , let the energy super expensive , then the energy support , it can afford it .
I mean , all of us here might be five times as much for our energy to pay without having changing our lifestyle .
The disaster is for that two ardless .
And even Lomborg has changed .
His credo is a zero , why isn &apos;t spot more about Re D .
He &apos;s going to be steady , because of his empowered , associated with the skeptical campaign , but he realized that a pretty champs , and he &apos;s now the Ree for the Reseveral progress .
And so there &apos;s a red wire that I think I &apos;m interested in .
And it &apos;s crazy about how little the Repet &apos;s been funded .
CA: Well , Bill, I suspect I was from the name of the massive people here when I say , I really hope that your wish for your wish in filling . Thank you very much .
BG: Thank you .
Now , you know , what I discovered a couple of massive when I wrote an article for the italian Wirescue .
I love the theaurus , I always love with the hand if I look at the existence , but I was finished with the check , and I thought I had never been the word for the word of invalization .
I read you the text .
Invaluable , nute , supportly , reveal , reveal , relief , nute , failure , reduce mutal , supplies , spreading , floor , public , supposed , public , public , disabled , disabled , disabled , disabled , disabled , dance , dancement , decental , dulnuttered , dry .
Antonious : healthy , capable of healthy .
I read this to a friend , and I read it for a friend , because it waste washing for me , but flushing a malledge of mutaneously , and I stopportunity to themselves because of the choice and the clap that these words .
Good , this is maintainly good thesis .
I don &apos;t think this is an old pressures .
But it was a pressure from the early &apos; 80s , when I started about the lower school and a picture of myself out of myself except for family , and related to the other children and the world to the world .
I don &apos;t have to say I don &apos;t have to say that when goddden no teacher .
With this environmental resources that I was born in a world for somebody when I was considered to say anything positial about , I worked in my life .
So I immediately went out to the 2009 , online edition , and waiting a bicycle .
This is the amazing version of the text .
Unfortunately .
I think , especially , in the last words of Dight-mental mental mental to be extract equisiational engineering .
It &apos;s not just about today .
It &apos;s about our opinion people as we following them with these vices .
The values behind the words , and how we construct those values .
Our language influences , and how we see the world and how we look at other people .
A lot of old societies include the Greeks and the Romen believed that the spread of a lique as powerful washing , because if you say something hardly tells that it gets .
So , what we want to do for reality , so we want to have a deaths , or a multiple of issue ?
When we do something simple to do something simple when the qualify of a personality , we limited them and working a shadow about their force .
Don &apos;t we far doors for them ?
Somebody who was in my doctor for me was my doctor , when I washing for A.I. Dupont Institute in Wilmon , Delawaree .
It &apos;s called Dr. Pizzutility .
Italian American , whose name was extremely hard to speaking , so he was to Dr. Please .
Dr. Ped always very colory towards very colory and had exactly the good institution to children .
I mean , I mean , almost everything in time I think in that disease , with exception of the physiotherapy of the physiotherapy session .
I mean , almost count-to-balyzed number of researches -- different colors -- to different colors -- to build my benefit .
And I hated that elaborate more than both .
I hattached them . I hattached them .
As a five-year-year-old child , I negotiated with Dr. Preference that exercise .
And one day he came in with a session -- and he came in with a session -- and he said to member , and he said to measure . Aien , you &apos;re such an empathy girl , I &apos;m going to make such a sense of empathroughout .
And if you allow for me to cut hundred hundred dollar .
Of course , this was a tactical put in front of Dr. P to let me do the practice I wanted to do the richest five-year-year-old girl of girl of the department , but what he actually did for me was a narrow , daily event to a currency ,
Today , I &apos;m going to ask to ask me in the correct vision and powerful girl , my self-vision girl , my self-image , as a inherently inherently , powerful and afforders in the future .
This is an example of how adult adults in power play powers .
But in the previous situations of that thesis , our language , our language our evolution to the reality that we all like to see , the opportunity for the individual to the individual .
Our language is following changes in society , and many of them are created by technologies .
With medical engineering , my gentlement , my gently treatments for worldwide , titanium bodies for old bodies to get more with their possibilities to deal with their possibilities to deal with their opportunity , to be able to deal with their own social network for themselves , to be able to be able to deal with the global networldwide , so that they can describe to the global with the world .
So perhaps technology is allowing us a lot of something that is always a truth : that everybody has something extraordinary and something powerful has too , and that ability to adapt us to our best property .
The ability of humans are interesting because everybody wants to continue , because everybody wants to confront with me , and I &apos;m going to do something now .
And that sentence has never nothing to me , and it felt uncomfortable to answer the questions of people , and I &apos;m starting to get to the questions of people .
The fragile extraordinary extremely that success or happiness , or happiness , means that success or happiness , regard , no surgerd , no business of public , as though my successfully , as if my successfully implies with artificial meaning , which others throughout of a life .
But in reality , we have changed . Of course , we &apos;re signed by a challenge , whether it &apos;s physicist , or both of them .
And my statement is that a good thing .
Today is not obstacle that we have to move through , but to be able to life .
It &apos;s a part of our life .
I have the tendency it as my shadow .
Sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes I see a lot , but it &apos;s always measure .
I wasn &apos;t going to impact the impact and the importance of someone &apos;s wildlife .
And there &apos;s challenge and challenge in the life , and it &apos;s all really all and for everyone else , but the question is not the question that you will have to represent , but how to replicate with it .
So , our responsibility is not simply to protect our to protect for contradiction , but they &apos;re good at it to be good at it .
We don &apos;t prove our children if we make them feel that they &apos;re not able to adapt to them .
There &apos;s an important difference and distinction between the objective fact that I &apos;ve been an amputed and the subjective society .
In fact , saying , the only actual disability that I was continued to describe is the world that you could describe to me with that describe me with that described to me with that definitely described me with that definitely described to me that described me that described to me that was described to me with those definition .
In our desire to protect our next to protect , by giving them the pound of their feet , or even a prognosis of the field of lively , we must have to be the multimate quality of life , we need to really involve someone that we really really involved the meal .
Maybe it makes the current way of looking at what &apos;s piece to you and how we have to fix it , somebody more repathology than the pathology selfish .
It doesn &apos;t matter to go from a personality of a personally , by their strength , not to recognize a new disease on the natural struggle of the naturally that they may be greeted .
In fact , we &apos;ve added somebody &apos;s added for our society .
So we &apos;ve got to look around the pathology around the pathology of magnitude .
The most important thing is that there &apos;s a collaboration between those visible text order and our best creative capability .
It &apos;s not going to default that difficult times or afford to exploration or whatever we want to avoid , but instead of that opportunities in the opportunity .
Perhaps the idea that I want to shape that you don &apos;t have so much to overwinner , but you have to open for it , but you have to open up a strengaging , but you have to use a strengine .
If we look at that as a naturally , consistant and useful , we &apos;re perhaps less .
This year we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin , and when he wrote 150 years ago , I think of evolution , which I think is a fact that the environment .
It &apos;s pretty translated , it &apos;s not the strongest species that survival , the most intelligent , but the species that realized the best thing to make sense .
Conflict is the genesis of creational .
On other from Darwinter , we can make the human ability to survive and driven by the human ability to be driven by the mental conflicts to transformation .
Again , transformation , transformation , which is our biggest capacity .
Until we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re talking about .
The other thing that is the one that opposite our office : self-realizing , a sense of our own force .
So we &apos;ve got ourselves a gift of ourselves .
We can re-imagine , as a more difficult than just , but it &apos;s difficult in time .
Maybe we can see it as a change .
Today change is a change that we don &apos;t even have adapted .
And I think the most important contradictionary that we &apos;ve given ourselves the understanding of our mality .
Who is there than normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s violence . There &apos;s a type . There &apos;s no normal .
And I think that &apos;s going to meet that armeans to meet as a massive ?
I thought it .
If we can deal with the paradigm of pursue to one of the opportunity , or potential , whether it &apos;s going to be a lot more kids , and they invitable to be a lot more kids , and they invite their rare .
Anthropologists are telling us that the only thing we need people of our groups of our groups are along to dragging .
There are evidence that Neanderthalers 60,000 years ago their elders , and perhaps narrative because the life experience and survival experience and survive from these people from value to the appropriate , they &apos;re not seeing and useless .
A few years ago I was on the market in the village where I grew up in the village that red piece in northern Pennsylvaniain , and I stood above over a troom .
It was a summer . I had a short broke .
I heard a guy behind me : Aimee , if Aimee Mullin
I turned around , it was an old male . It was an idea of male .
And I &apos;m like , of Pardonor , I can &apos;t remember that grid .
And he said , &quot; It &apos;s good possible that you don &apos;t know anymore .
When we meeting each other , I had to meeting you from your encourage ,
Okay .
And it was the quarter of the quarter .
This man was a doctor Keaning , a guy I just killing through my mom , because I was going to be tellyfish , because I came out of my own birthday .
So , my modern doctor had been a vacation of a vacation , so the man who was a strange for my age .
And because I was born without any sharing feeding feet , and a couple of tens to the other feeding , the weird of feeding the bad news .
And he said to me , you know , I mean , you know , I think , you could never have any movement , and it would have no motivity to have other kids and totally have no independent life could have no independent lives at all the time of my mind .
And the extremely maintainly , he was collected by my childhood during my childhood during my childhood whether it was that I gave a game lawon in the case , marched with the particular games , my University engineered , or one of my sportorities , and he use the guy , integrated it in his life , integrated it for his life , integrated it for the Hah , and the Hah and the chlay , and the engineering ched Hering .
Of course , he called this the x-facility , the potential of the wildlife .
No progress can predict how powerful this can predict how powerful this can be as excellent factor for quality .
Dokter Kean went away , he sea : I &apos;m experiencing , if it &apos;s not going to be constantly contradiction , and even with except for excells , a child out of themselves .
See , doctor Kean had thought change .
He understood that there is a difference between the empathy and what somebody could do with it .
And in the course of time , my thinking has changed , if you had asked me as a 15-year-old , or I would have my art legs for real legs , I had no doubt .
I was supposed to such as normality .
If you ask me now than I know it now , I &apos;ll know it &apos;s like that .
That &apos;s because of the experiences that I haven &apos;t despite the experiences that I haven &apos;t despite the experiences .
Perhaps this changed in me because I &apos;m more exposed to people who have opened for me than those doors who wanted me to do me and shadom .
Take , you have only one human being shows you the open up of your own force , and there &apos;s going to be .
And if you can somebody the key to its own exercise , the mind is so received , if you can , and in an essential moment a door for somebody can opening them in the best way .
You learn to open up the doors .
And the exactly meaning of the word for the word of amazing exactly
And that means that what &apos;s inside is to form and bringing out , potential , potential to outside .
So again , what potentially potential , what potentially potential ?
There was a case-study in the 1960s , in English , where they from gymnasia to schools ,
It &apos;s called the extension of challenge . In the United States , we call the wildlife .
They distribute for 9, 98, and so on and so on .
It &apos;s a very difficult to get a difficult packager , the best teacher , etc .
Great a three massive , they gave 4-meets , they were telligent , and they were telligent to heat .
At the end of the three massively majority .
The heart rate of these study is that they &apos;re telling is that they &apos;re telling the meaning of the challenge that they were dealing .
And that happened after three months .
Those of them in school wareness , the people who had gotta .
A critical part of this research was that the teachers were also wildlife .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that there was a switch .
And there was a teenaged : these are the present of teenth , this one with square .
And so they went out and so they were treated sea .
I think the only real hands disabled a mindset of spirit , a collapsed mind .
It doesn &apos;t see a beauty .
He doesn &apos;t have our natural curiosity , child &apos;s curiosity , not yet us unborn ability .
If we can stay the spirit of the mind to be hope , to keep beauty in itself and others and others to size themselves and fantasy and fantasy full of the wine , we actually use our features .
When a spirit of these qualities of spirit , we &apos;re able to realize new reality .
I want to finish with a poem century Perza-century Persian poem , Having my friend Jacques on told me .
And the poem is called &quot; The god of four words knowledge
Every child knows Godd , not the God of beef , not the God of clottery , but the God who repeated to the extent that he repeat repeat repeatendance with mircumbers of miracle , dance with mine .
Thank you .
