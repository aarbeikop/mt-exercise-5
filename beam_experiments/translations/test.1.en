A few years ago , Peter Skillman has shown here at TED, a design competition .
The marshmallow-challenge-challenge-challenge-challengely .
The idea is pretty simple : Grepearing four of the work with 20 of spaghettks , a very high process of spaghette , a massive , and a marshmallowed .
The marshmallow mallow to the marshmallow .
And it &apos;s just the sounds of left , it turns out , it &apos;s still quite hard because this assignment people &apos;s going to work together .
And because I decided this kind of varcular idea , I decided to take it in a design workshopping .
And it was a big successful .
Since then , I &apos;ve done this exercise in about 70 design workshops around the world with the exercise , designers and engage of Fortune , and even with Fortune 50-company .
And this exercise gives us deep insights in how people collaboratory , and I want to department a few of you .
And in fact , the first step is the first step that people are on the case .
She &apos;s resources for how it &apos;s going to play out of the power play , play games .
And then they go planners , organizer .
They &apos;re sketches and monstruggling .
The biggest part of the time they &apos;re going to build up the spaghettes .
And on the end , when time , when time , they take somebody the marshmallow them to do a bunch of the marshmallow , they do a bunch of the time , Taaake !
They &apos;re admire their towards the workforce .
But what really happened is that the master is that the dealt of the task of the providing of the real-having the marshmallow for the entire building work , and intense .
Now , the people have more of that &apos;s extremely the extraordinary of the meaning of the meaningdom .
What of the worst is only graduated with a MBA.
They play , they play for the last , and they make sure for the reality .
And then there are a meaning of the present that a lot more of the excellent makes sense of massive .
And the best of them are just taking off coluter-graduated .
That &apos;s a impressive .
And Peter tells , that they &apos;re not just making the highest building .
So what you &apos;re going to ask you , how do you get to dive , what do that ? What do that do that little column ?
Peters answer issue , it &apos;s a Gone of the children &apos;s boss to be the boss of Spagency BV.BV.
They don &apos;t wasting time with power games .
But there &apos;s another reason .
And that &apos;s it that economists are to find the only right right right now for the most of the Interests .
And then they go out that out .
But what happened is when they &apos;re going to happen when they &apos;re in the marshmallow is that they don &apos;t greegreed time . And dancing ?
It &apos;s a disaster .
Couounds are certainty ?
What &apos;s going to do is a different thing --
is that they with the marshmallow initial .
They build prototyping prototype , and new prototyping
And the marshmallow upper , so they have more opportunity to repair .
Discreening this employment of an iterative processional .
And the metaneously , the kids get a feedback about what &apos;s not a feedback and what it is not going to work .
So , the building prototypes is very important .
But let &apos;s see how different teams the downtown .
The average for the medium of the medium of the medium of the medium of the medium of the medium of the medium of the average of the medium of the medium of the medium of the medium of the mediately for the medium of the medium .
economists there are half , the hands-on the joocts , but not a lot of terribly .
Commas , better than the extraction .
Who does it spend ?
chitects and engineering , happily .
The highest building that I &apos;ve seen was a high-legal .
And what &apos;s the extremely rement , and self-decrease geometry and confident geometry to build stable to build stable towards stable to build stable towards stable to .
CEOur &apos;s slightly better than average .
But now it &apos;s interesting to be a secretary at the team , they &apos;re getting a secretary ,
Incredible . You see the team and thinking : Take a wind wind .
That can you visit from the view . And what about it ?
And the thing they &apos;re good at support to support .
They managency to understand the processes .
And every team that &apos;s good realized and attention for the work of the team is going to be good comentable ,
And specialized and supportive skills lead to a successful .
If you normally get 10 teams to do this , there will be a massive to be a major job work .
And I tried to try something interesting .
I thought , we make it a little exciting .
So I was going to be a few of the wind of wind from winning teams .
And what do you think these design means that are definitely definitely definitely definitely ?
What happened ?
The next ones .
No one team had a state of state .
A separate single , a cancement , was enough to get to price to price .
And it &apos;s a more interesting thing that &apos;s called higher input .
We have the exercise repeately with the exercise .
And what do you think that as eventually happened ?
So now they &apos;re understanding the prototypes .
And this team changed the worst team in one of the bad team in one of the business .
They made the highest built in the minulfilled in the least .
So that &apos;s a good lesson for us about the nature of rewards and successful .
You may be saying , why , why would somebody want to spend time to spend a long time to the present of a marshmallowed ?
The reason , I work on making digital tools and processes to help with the digital tools and to help with building teams of autools and visual effectively .
And the marshmallow-challenge helps them to come back the hidden assumption .
Wanta , honest project has its own marshmallowed , no way ?
The challenge is a given to an experience the reality , a separate language , a gentle-prototype .
And so that &apos;s the value of the experience of this so exercise exercise .
And for the course of the massive visit , go to marshmallowchallenge .
And in this blog , you can see how you have to build the mashmallows .
There are step for step structions .
There are previous about how people around the world have tricks and adaptations have challenges and adaptation .
There are also a world records .
And the fundamental lesson , think , really , design a contact sports .
It &apos;s the protein of all our senses , and that we use our best thinks , feel the best knowledge and execution for the challenge that our ligtory for us .
And sometimes , sometimes , a small prototype of this experience to be the ademic of the malle-to-having a malization of the mind of the extraordinary moment .
And that makes a big differently .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s just assume that we have a machine , a big machine , a big machine , a major machine , a major inequal thing , and it &apos;s still a time machine for a timeless .
And everybody here must be involved here .
You can get in the time or forward in the time , but not here and it &apos;s now .
I &apos;m genty what you would choose , because I &apos;ve asked this question all kinds of friends , and they want to all to go back .
They all want to go back to time before autowards the Twitter or Twitter or Twitter , for the meaning of the empathy of the empathy of the empathy of the empathy of the empathy of time before .
I know it &apos;s nothing .
I &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s a certain hang of nostallel , to state .
And I can get in the next .
But I don &apos;t hear there , I have to say that .
I don &apos;t want to return back , and not because I &apos;m so adventure -- but for the potential of these planetary .
They &apos;re not going to go forward , who are going to forward .
So I want to go in the case and I want to go forward in the time .
We live in the violence time on this planet on what area , but what area , you want to do , riches , cancsensory , cansensory , disease , disease of disease .
Never was a time as desea .
My grandparents are all the time of 60s .
My grandparents were all 70s .
And my parents are already at the 800s .
So I can do it in the 90 piece of the ninth half .
But it &apos;s not just about under .
There &apos;s a lot more on the game .
A kid that New Delhi is born in New Delhi has a life-expectancy , in the world is going back 100 years .
Think about that . That &apos;s an incredible facts .
And why is that truths ?
The smallpox . The smallpox have people on this planet of life .
They had an influence on the demography of this world bigger than any war .
But they &apos;re not multiple . They &apos;re floating .
We &apos;ve overwhelmed them . Pof!
In the wealthy world disease , which is a generation of millions of people threatened , as good as not millions of people , as good as not multiple .
Diftery , rodehond-relation ,
somebody here still know what that that ?
Intermining , modern medicine our possibilities to supply for the argument , all are triumph to support of the scientific methodescenders .
And for me , is the scientific methode, the except of dinently , see if it works and it &apos;s indiand names indiand names of the human actual .
That &apos;s the good news .
But I &apos;m going to be that the only good news because there are some other problems , they &apos;re also involved for a lot of time , and a date of it is date for all of our resistency , there &apos;s still a wild-having humans to bed in this global every day .
Their number of takes , and it takes sense , and it &apos;s a challenge .
And not just date , we also have our imagination to pollutting this world &apos;s resources .
Drink waterfarmers , agrony rainforest , gas: they &apos;re disappearance , and if we &apos;re not able to be able to allow us to be able to innovation from this mission , also will be the way to work , we &apos;re gone .
The question is , Can we have this question .
I think it &apos;s clear that we &apos;re able to be able to make sure for the realization of the existence that we &apos;re able to live out of the country ,
I think we can see these world of energy forms that I don &apos;t think in the realm of energy that &apos;s already slums .
I believe that eventually , nose , that &apos;s not a wish of knowledge .
But now , I think that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to wake up at night -- one of the things that I &apos;m going to woke up .
Never we have been so dependent on scientific progress , necessarily , and never we &apos;re able to make sure of it as we have been able to make sure that we have today .
We &apos;re on the threshold of the most amazing advantage of all kinds of region .
And I think we really have to say that hundreds of jarency , say , 300 years , to find a time of the Ulight-in-time of the Ulightly to find a time that we &apos;re so against this innovations that we &apos;re hearing these innovations sought from birthumbers than borhood .
People hundressed their faith with such a dealt of heart that it &apos;s impossible to make it sense of it .
And so , everybody has right at its own mental ; everybody has even got the right on a very operating on what the process of , but you don &apos;t know where you don &apos;t have a right on a right ?
You don &apos;t have a straight on your own facts . Nevolution . Nevol.
And I &apos;ve done a while about it to realize that .
A teenaged a story about inently writing a story of inently , for the New York City , for a second ,
I was amazed by understanding , against what actually , the most effective maattractive maattracking public health .
I didn &apos;t know what I do , so I wrote a story and I just went on and I went on .
A little bit later , I wrote a story of genetically depleasant .
With self-de, but it turns worse .
People are cheating .
So I wrote there , but a story , I could not understand why people this is a fine risk of the meaning of the meaning of moleculate , in a foundation of realm , instead of a sitting against nature .
Milorse , I know what I &apos;m doing . I wrote a story and I wrote a story and I was now about the homeless . I &apos;m now , we &apos;re going to do it , we &apos;re going to eat and that &apos;s what we &apos;re eating and that is date .
But these stories are benefit , I couldn &apos;t make it extremely considered .
And because the fanaticians who made me , in fact , no fanaticians .
They were a very days , good subject , right ?
like the people in this business .
And it was just that what me so solid .
but then frowd , allow the empathy , we &apos;re at a moment , in this world , we &apos;re not at a time to be a meaning of mind , as a well-empaign .
We &apos;re talking about two-laby .
We &apos;re talking about it as between the history of the supporting step .
Take a vantage of the major of the meaning of the meaning of the reality of the means of the world .
OK, there are reasons and I think we also , and I think we know it .
We &apos;re lying the believing institutions , in the science , and then in science , and there &apos;s no reason why no reason why no reason .
You only have to drop a few names , and people understand what they &apos;re going to understand .
Tsjernobyl, Bhopped Challenge , Viox, mass destruction destruction , not good personal weaponate , not good ponent mass tendency .
I mean , you can see your list sustaining .
There are questions and problems with those people that we thought they always equal hateful .
So , you &apos;re skeptitutory .
So , imagine , ask prove and evidence of al, you don &apos;t just want to be anything .
But now , if you get evidence , you have to get them to get them , and you don &apos;t have to be so good .
And the reason I can say that is that we &apos;re now in a very far angstep of having angstep life and which we hope that they &apos;ll be going to be flip as possible .
About 12 years , there was a terrible story , a terrible story , that a connected between the epidemic of autism and the inenting against major and the inenting against majority .
Angsting .
And they &apos;re executed to go out or this true .
And that &apos;s a very severe seekend .
The data was paying fortunate .
She found in the United States , in English , in Swedish , in Cand, and in Cand, and all the result of the mesh .
But it doesn &apos;t matter , it doesn &apos;t matter because we believe belief ancekenly , we believe what we think and what we think , and what we think we really think .
We can &apos;t believe a belief of a bunch of a sacrifying government institution that we all the data from the data , and I think we all that art .
But you know watching water ?
The consequences were catastrophic , and it &apos;s about this : The United States are one of the world in the world where the number of inentions are against the majority and down ga-to-centaging .
That &apos;s a shake , and we should have to collect our damage .
It &apos;s a terrible .
What &apos;s going to do with us that we could decide that we could decide to decide that we could decide it to decide that we could decide it to decide that we could decide it to decide that we could decide to decide that we could decide that to decide that we could decide it to decide that we could decision to decide that we could decide to decide
And I understand what I understand .
Who gets some more commodity ?
Do anybody see anybody ever see anybody see die of mazines ?
Come not often .
And all the measurest of the last year , but it happened last year , 160,000 times in the world .
That &apos;s a lot of killed by mazing-per nervous .
But because it &apos;s not going to be here , we can remember the relatively , and people like Jenny McCarthy , and of anxiety Keeeedge and invading in the Oprah and Larry King ,
And they can do that because they can &apos;t make a distinct between ordinary and accidental conditions of the indistinction .
They don &apos;t understand that these things like , but it &apos;s practical practical .
And that &apos;s something that we need to learn and that we need to teach , and that we need to teach the existence .
This guy was a bright , Jonas Salkida .
He &apos;s been a dealing of one of our worst .
No anxiety , no death memerator . Polios , putting .
That guy in the middle , also , along .
He &apos;s called Paul Offith .
He developed a variety of the croots of the meless of the mental .
The rescue of the lives of such as 400,000 to 500,000 children in the third world .
Good , tocheer ?
Well , it &apos;s good except for that Paul threat with promist of the regulately of the regulately .
and that people should stop it to hold in order to hundred .
And so he says it &apos;s the ookie .
So Paul is a terrorist .
If he &apos;s a public deallows than that can only be in grid of lifarmers .
He gets home phone call because there are people who are price to say they know where his children are lying there to them to say they know where his children are school lapse .
And what &apos;s the extremely realized that Paul has developed a wild .
I don &apos;t have to say it , but the most of the meaning of his unrelationship .
Take them , take the diseases will return terrible disease , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
We have returned into this country .
And it &apos;s going to be reverted short , again , when children go die , if there &apos;s enough disease .
And they will not only be majority and killing .
What about polio-town . Why don &apos;t it ?
A former fellow memory of seem to wrote , and said she said , &quot; She was going to go to me and since that she said , &quot;
Nobody has ever sleeval me that ever sleeval me that ever hit me .
She wasn &apos;t replicated her child .
It &apos;s not a clear .
Good .
What &apos;s the meaning of the equivalo . And you know watch ?
As not before you got to stage polio here .
More , the realizes of the wetorrow , maybe somebody on an airplane in Laghter Angeler , he &apos;s now above to Los Angeleler , he &apos;s now above right now .
Within a few hours , a car , and it comes to Long , for Long , for Long , for a multiple hours .
And he doesn &apos;t realize that he &apos;s inflammented with a paralyzes , and we don &apos;t know because that &apos;s the dataset .
That &apos;s the planet for us .
We &apos;re going to far our in the meaning of the present .
Have everyone tomorrow have gone out of smart ?
Echinacademic of the reality to the day by artistic ?
I know because half the Americans every day .
They &apos;re allowing it and using alternative drug , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we discovering that they need to realize that they value .
The data is always reinforces again .
They &apos;re making your urine darkness . And they never practically more than date .
OK , if you want to spend 28 dollars for dark urin , Dan , you know , Dan &apos;s just like that .
Donta . Doncertainly .
Why do we do that ? I think I understand that I understand it , we hate Big Pharmation .
We hate the government . We won the government .
That has to cook-to-providing health resistance .
They are for millions of our country &apos;s lenotenotenty .
They &apos;re amazing heart root , and even detected for those of us that they can permitter-business .
So we &apos;re walking from away , and where we walk up to ?
We &apos;re in the arms of Big Placeboard .
Davily , I love Big Placeboard .
Mealization , this is very , very , because the whole thing is doing it , and we give you a lot of them to extent , and we &apos;re giving the wild of dollars .
I &apos;ve got some of those things here .
Ginkangogg, chinacaim , cheese , I don &apos;t even know what that isn , but we &apos;re giving for it to be a shake of dollars ,
And you know watch watch this ? If I tell the people to me to call it against me , and they say , what can you get ? Let the people &apos;s deaths to the deaths of the people .
They feel good about it .
And you know watch ? You are mistake .
I &apos;m not going to care not to care of whether it &apos;s the health service of the health service service that &apos;s setttelling me : a gorgeous thing to tell you about mmammography for the experts of mammography .
or the other cancer square zilliver that are for the meaning of coffee .
If you start replaces and replace in science and replaced by believable and magic than you don &apos;t have to come out .
And then you get terrifying in the South Africa of Tabo Mbbekidding Africa .
He &apos;s responsible for 400,000 people of his people by obvious that bits , that babroots , butttttons , practice of effectively than the means of AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of crowd in a country that has been placed by this disease .
Come not tell me that these things don &apos;t tell me that these things .
They have . They have altitude .
Now , the most thousand mind epidemic of the empathy of the supported between device , the multimated malmost of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the support of genetic epidemic .
It &apos;s a major debath . It must stop .
It &apos;s going to be various .
It &apos;s ideology , not scientific .
Everything we &apos;re going to do , every single of richness , every single of the air , is extremely cheat , is because of human mentally mutaneously .
Now , if you think , there &apos;s a real-a-to-a-potential , don &apos;t multiple munders .
It didn &apos;t exist any water meloent .
Even no Christbs bomb . They all come from ourselves .
We had to be able to do it in the last 1,000 jarently .
Something that &apos;s business of products and others were having the none .
We &apos;re not exploration of what we &apos;re not appropriate .
Now we can do a little bit more regulately .
En, certainty there are risks of connection .
But we can produce rice to produce millions of producing millions of life and longer .
Do you don &apos;t want to address ?
I have to handle it , I don &apos;t understand .
We don &apos;t want genetic modified .
And what about what ?
Well , this is a lot of chemistry , too many chemicals , hormoncity , monoculary , monocultural , monoculary , we don &apos;t want to be a right-wing fields of the awashing , for the damage of the welling .
We don &apos;t like companies that take patents of living on living dinner .
We don &apos;t want to sound that companies the property rights .
And you know what I answered on that ?
You have a similar . Let &apos;s downtown .
It &apos;s value . Our problem is overwhelming the gene is overwhelming , but that &apos;s not a science .
It has nothing to do with science .
This is going to be legitians , morality , patently patently .
Science is not a society .
No language .
Even no ideas . It &apos;s a processional .
It &apos;s a proces, and sometimes it works and sometimes .
But the idea that we have to heat the science to do it because we &apos;re afraid to do it , because we really get millions of people heating to the only well-original well-original awful .
Weat jump , in the next 50 years we will need more of the meaning for 70percent more ,
70 procentlement .
This is a graph , it &apos;s a distinvestment in Africa for the last 30 year .
Schandalgatalgatalgatory .
They really need it and we remember the hengaging .
And the reason ? Genetic depleasant to be well-a-realized .
We don &apos;t want people to be a minority as a cassave examples , except for excellent .
Cassave is the daily affected a half a regard-to-and-a-half mental mental .
It &apos;s just a lot of calory . Werealoosing .
It doesn &apos;t contain any meaning enough of protein and scientists are considered to downtown , something there .
And that people can eat without being able to eat without being worked .
They wouldn &apos;t revested , and you know watched watching ?
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t cute cash , but it would be fine .
And all I have to say , why are we distitute ?
I mean , let &apos;s say we agreed that , why are we going to be there ?
that we don &apos;t want to shuffs with gene ?
This is about enjoying the benefit . Have nothing to chemistry .
Also , not with our ridiculous passion for hormonths , our desire to multiply , better and special event .
It &apos;s not about Rice Krimmiracy , it &apos;s about people in life .
and it &apos;s about to understand that we want to start to understand what that is going .
Now , the thing you know watching ?
If we don &apos;t do it and continuous as we are going to be , we &apos;re going to be able to something that we don &apos;t want to be bully to be : the gang member ,
I don &apos;t think that any other way to describe this better .
It &apos;s self-size and longer , our indignostil , and we really need to door something .
So after this unimaginable resource of performal existence , you might want to be able to say , with this ridiculous time of realizing the malory of the meaningful for reality to be the death-molar sets of the meaning of the existence of the existence of settt
Absolute , I want to date date .
Now , she &apos;s still in the poorest , but we have an amazing probability .
We can do that for that time for all we want to use .
We can bring them to a meaning that we want to walk into the meaning that we &apos;re going to bring them to where we want to wild length .
We have to continue with these elequipment , and we need to keep national , but if we &apos;re going to get into it and fortunate , we &apos;ll be happy that we &apos;ve heard it .
I know we &apos;re the artistic , and that , for what I &apos;m telling to me , something that the world needs to science .
Thank you .
Thank you .
A columnist of the Los Angeles Times--
Steve Lopezy , walking on a day ...
by the center of Los Angelescopyright
when he heard music .
It came from a manage .
A black manage .
Chartter , label label , homeless .
And so , I was played on a violent , but two string .
I &apos;m telling now that many of you all science
because the columns of Steve the basic ...
for a view of a film was made .
Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Steve Lopeza ,
Jamie Foxx who &apos;s Nathony Ayers...
the classic contrast ,
that are more likely to be related career for demand
because he was suffering to paranoid shifts .
Nathanel stopped with the Juilliard-conservatium , stortune .
And 30 years later , he swiring homeless
by the poorest streets of Los Angelestigate .
You should read Stest &apos;s meaning for the feature .
Next just for the wonderful band-...
that was the two male between these two male .
But also to see what role music playful music .
a tool role-lame role, if I say that I say ,
to Nathaniel from the street .
I met Ayers in 20088...
two years , in a Disney-concertal .
He had sound to a performed the 1th and 4th symphony of the 1th and 4th symphony of the methovens ...
and backstage and represented .
He spoke on a jobvious and social existence of the realm
Yeah , the extraordinary of the extent of the extent .
And so , in fact , the Dodgers never would say the World Ssions .
And all the actual leading of a telepassage ,
in the last part of the fourth symphony of the ethoven-ethoven-ethoven-ethoven-to-to-final symphony of
We talked about music . Later , I got a mail from Stevices
that Nathanel lightful to be a violet of me get a violet of greehable .
You have to know that Nathaniel doesn &apos;t want to be treatment .
When he was treated when he was treated shocket therapy .
chlorpromomacazine and handbooishine ,
and that has draw him for his life .
And the result is that he &apos;s number ,
attacks of schizophrenia .
Tewell-to-to-fal-scale .
plowing up .
and he disappears .
He &apos;s going to be over the street ...
and the devote of that narratives and the devantory in his heady
that following up at the time .
Nathaniel was in the sweek of state ,
when we understanding our first lesson .
He had a male gloed in such sense .
He was gone .
He &apos;s talking to overcome
invisible demons and smoke ...
and somebody who wanted him in sleep him in sleep .
I was bangery .
Next for self-meeting , I was bang...
I &apos;d gone to cause ...
that he would sleee out in such a sense of attacks
and I would be relationship with the violent ...
when I started talking about toonlagdder ,
and arpeggioem , and other exciting examples
of what you with violic lessons .
So I started playing out .
I played the first part of the vioil of the vioil concert of the meanoven-eves .
And as I playful ,
I &apos;m a clear changing .
in the eyes of Nathanielians .
It was like a invisible medicine his work .
A chemical reaction that my player for the game ,
the catalyzes of catalyze .
The manic winding Nathaneeliures
changed in understanding .
In silly news yesterday news , and free .
And if by a wonder , he swamp of a wood-to-to-wells
and started playing on the hear .
And the providing of viow-to-concern
that I &apos;m going to recognize . Mendelss ,
Taikovsynsychovsynthesis .
We started to talk about music , from Bachieving Bachievement .
to be ethoven and Brahms...
Brug , all the Buknership .
From Barte to Esa-Peka Salonena Salonena .
I mean , I don &apos;t know ,
a encyclopedical musical musical knowledge ,
but he was hit personally hit by that personal music .
He talked about it with the realizes of the meaning
and the deavor of message , and mal-college realization .
from the Los Angeles Philharmonicity .
By making music and make music ,
This guy changed .
from the paranoid , confusion
that justice of the stratent ,
from Los Angeles had been compartment
in a charmlapse ,
brilliantly sculp-lass-musicus .
Music maedge . Music changes .
For Nathaniel is a healthy .
And by music , he can be his minds to be a mind-to-day
and departments that are reshape
through his fantasy and creativity
in reality .
And the empathy of the air .
They &apos;re troubledged attacks .
I think that the essential of art .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re maintaining music .
And that we all take something that in our own size ,
deep in our nuclear .
Our extraordinary .
And that we have through our artistic lensers
through our crtivity that allowed to reality .
The reality of that expressions --
Take us allel .
We &apos;re going to inspired and united .
Nathanielil .
And then , by music , a group of friends .
The reason of music was going back ,
in a family of musician ...
who he understanding him ,
those are talents of them --
and that he respected him .
I &apos;ll always keep on going to be able to keep music with Nathanilielong .
Now , it &apos;s now in Walt Disney Concert Hall isen
or on the streets . He reminds me of it .
why I &apos;ve been a musicus .
Dantelular .
Thank you .
Robert Gupta.
I want to play something that I &apos;ve got to play a shame of cellists .
It &apos;s meaning .
I &apos;m Jane McGongal. I &apos;m a game design design .
All 10 years I do is games .
And my goal for next decade , is to make it easy for a second to save the world as it is in game .
Number , I have a plane for this , and that plan is to convince more human , you all include to spend more time to spend more time to the play of bigger and better game .
We are playing three of the wildlife a week online game .
Some of you think , some of you are thinking about that &apos;s a lot of time to play games .
Maybe too many of the time , there are so many of the problems in the real world that must be a disconnected .
But actually , I think , in my research at the Institute Vefor the Toes , which is the opposite where issue .
Three of three of the most remote of the world &apos;s world-most problems of solute problems .
Mealization , I believe that if we want to do the next century on this planet , that we need to increase that digit .
I have realized that we need for 21 a.m. tune mee-process .
That &apos;s a strange ideas , so I &apos;ll just sleeping it , I &apos;ll make it sense .
And if we want to be a wild problems like hungry , climate change , globally , I believe we need to try and do that we need to try to play weekness , I think we need to try to play weekness to the end of the next decades to the end of the next decades of the incentive of the center of the intention of the center of the incental Nevolule .
This is the reason . This picture is a fairly good together why games are so important for the future of humanity . It &apos;s a very important to which is the future of humanity .
This is a portrait by a photographer , Phil Toleddanot .
He wanted the case of the games of games .
So he put a camera for gamers of gamers ,
And this is a classic for classic empathy .
Number if you don &apos;t gamer gammer games , you &apos;re a little bit of a games .
You see the sense of the sense of the feeling , a little bit of anxiety , but also intense consistent focus to a very difficult problem to solve a very hard time .
If you gamer a gamer gamer here you &apos;ll put a few nuances : the cheer tangle , the cheat of the eyes and mouth is a text of optimisme-.
The wentkrows up to the wall of a teaching of surprising .
This is a gamer that &apos;s about the state of something that &apos;s hot : a sense of epile .
Ahh , you know . Okay .
So we have a couple of gamers here .
A demand a device of a well-being so incredibly positive , that you didn &apos;t know it was possible to the well-to-your mind .
It was almost not to imagine .
And when you go down there , you &apos;re a surprised to find what you really art . That &apos;s a sense of the epiphany .
This is a gamer at the point of view of view &apos;s wild to exist .
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of problems around the world , we &apos;re trying to see the next few cheat of the next century .
The face of somebody , against all the expectations , at the point is to exist a sense of profit .
But unfortunately , we see this face in the daily life , we &apos;re trying to packaging problems .
This is what I think I &apos;m Ben Neweling the examples of the Levelusions .
And this is I actually towers . Can you see the size of the size ? Ja. Good .
This is me the present of Ben Newell-examples .
This is a piece graffiti in my old neighborhood in Berkeling Californiah , where I did my PhD about why we are better in games than in the real life .
And this is a problem that much gamers .
We don &apos;t feel good in the reality , as we are in games .
And I mean , not only that &apos;s successful , even though that &apos;s part of it .
We &apos;re in the measurely , but I mean , I mean , but I also mean , I also mottively motivated to work together .
And when we are in a game world , I believe that most of us the best version of ourselves words , the most likely to slength of ourselves , the most likely to mind dealing for mind .
the most likely to be as long as it is to keep a problem , to remain , to a failure .
And if we were in the real life , we don &apos;t have to be a failure , when we confront of hundreds of times , we don &apos;t feel often .
We feel that we &apos;re overwhelmed . We feel overwhelmed .
We feel rather threatened , maybe depressed , or cynishing .
We never have those feelings when we share games .
They &apos;re not exist in games .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I &apos;m going to be washing for a meeting .
What &apos;s part of games is it impossible we feel like we don &apos;t feel anything ?
How can we take those feelings of games and make them applies in the real world ?
So I looked games like Word of Wared War-wish for Word , that really is the ideal cooperative environment to solve problems .
And I started to think of the meaning of the realization that makes sense in the online world-line world-world .
The first thing I noticed is that every time you in one of those online games , particularly World of War-weling , much diversity , there &apos;s a lot of diversity that you like to have a global reason for me , measured .
But not just a mission , a mission that mission is a mission that &apos;s appropriate perfectly to your living in games . Jstishing ?
Dush , you can do it downtown .
They never give you a challenge you don &apos;t add a challenge that you don &apos;t .
But it &apos;s the best of the possibility . So , you have to do hard time .
But there &apos;s no employment in World of Warld of the wildlife .
You can &apos;t sit down to a kidness .
There &apos;s always something specific and important that is done , and important that has to be done .
And there are also a lot of contributes .
Every place where you galay , there are hundreds of thousands of people who are willing to help you to help your epic mission .
That &apos;s something that we &apos;re in the real life of tough , that sense that there is that in our realizes are very much more collaborators .
And also that there &apos;s an epic story , this involves tells why we are here and what we downtold us why we are here and what we downtold .
And then all the positive feedback that we get genuine .
You &apos;ve been heard of a living rise and plus-force an intelligence , and plus-up an intelligence .
And so , as a constant back-stream , we get to the real life .
When I here from this stage , I will not get a message of the plus-up , I will not get a messy , plus-20 ganky ideas .
I don &apos;t get feedback in the real life .
Number the problem with collaborative online worlds like Warld of Warld Warld of Warld Warld of a deaths of a deep-profit , that we decided to spent our time to spent our time to spent our time to spent our time to spent our time to spent our own time .
It &apos;s just better than reality .
And now , as far as a Warld of Warld Warld wine , 5.93 million years to spend the virtual problems of Azero-ed-order to spend the virtual problems of Azero-or-to-field .
Number that is not a bad thing .
It sounds may be worked .
To clear that a minute : 5.93 million years ago , our first of all ,
That was the first one , right operating primeal .
So , as we &apos;re as a measurely about the amount of time we invest in the game of gametal , is the only way to think about it is to even knowledge of the time in context of the context of the context , which is a very single thing .
But it &apos;s also disconnected . It turns out that way that we &apos;re going to change in a lot of measuring , we &apos;re going to change the same way we are able to change as people .
We evolve to a kind of more cooperative and education .
This is what I think . I think I ditend .
Duses think about this interesting .
It was published by a researcher of the Carnegie Mellon University .
The average young of medium , in a country with a major game cultural , for a long time , it &apos;s been a regreeted to a medium of time , against the time he &apos;s 21 years old .
Audience , for a lightly interesting cycle for two reasons .
Ten hearing , for children in the United States is 080 hours , the exactly among the exactly among the time you spent at school from the fifth year to your graduate when you &apos;re always appropriate .
So we have a wising gang of education where young young learning about the games like they do a lot of the games in school .
Some of you have a meaning of Malcom Gladell-employment of the Outligent .
So you &apos;ve heard of his successful theory , the existence of the successful theory .
It &apos;s on this great dignity , cognitive scientific research , that says that if we can control for a long study of the same time that we can control for a few of the time , we have virtual virtual in wordddle .
We will be a good at what we do as the best we do as the best of the world .
And what we &apos;re seeing now is a whole generation of young people who are virtuoes in the game .
Duses , the big question , Where are becomes so good for gamers , are going to be so good for the realm of the realm of the extremely realizes that the major question of the extremely regardamers ,
And as we can behind that , we would be virtual disincent supply of human potential .
This is the number of people who now in the world at least hours a day games .
These are our virtuous virtuous .
500 million people who are very good at extraordinary .
And in the next decade , we &apos;ll have a messages of gamers that extraordinary good at something .
If you don &apos;t remember it , this competable .
The gaming-industry is consoon , that it needs very little stream and needed to have wireless telephone networks so that gamers of all over the world &apos;s business , mostly in Indian , mostly , the case of Brazil .
They expect to a meaning of gamers against the decades .
That brings us to 1.5 pillion gamers.
So I wondered , so I wonder this games of the games of virtuoches .
I have four feeds of the most of the frequently optimismely .
Okay . This is a way , you can see as extreme self-motivately .
And then , the will be combined to action metable , to a handle a hundred of account , combined with the believable opportunity .
Gambers always believe that a device of wind , and that it &apos;s always worth the epipe of wine , and then now it &apos;s going to be able to do a farmers .
Gamers knights .
Gamers are virtuoes in the weight of a dense social standards .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that we have people rather after we have a play with them , although they have the toy of the meaningful for the meaningful .
The reason is that you need to have a trust to play with somebody .
We faith that they will continue to spend their time , that they will be played to play for the rest of the meaning , that they &apos;ll keep the mind to the game for issues .
So , a play of a game with somebody the underlying , the trust and the confidence .
And as a result , we actually build more social relatively .
Salia productivity .
And I think of the medium of the average World of Warld of Warld Warld Warld of 22 hours a week , almost like a half time famous time .
That &apos;s because we know that when we play a game , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard than if we received or anywhere .
We know that as people are made to deliver , useful , useful work .
And gamers are prepared to work hard , when they give the right work , if they give the right work .
And finally , epic meaning .
Gammers are low-floating crime of the crime , stories of planetary scales .
And it &apos;s a small weett to be a little bit of a little wety ,
You all of the Wikipedia , the biggest weight in the world .
The biggest weki in the world , with almost 80,000 articles is the World of Warld of Warld ,
Five million people use it every months .
They have more info about World of Warld of Warld Warld Warld Excelly-to-other kip .
They &apos;re building a epic story .
They &apos;re building a sigical source of knowledge about World of Warld ,
So , those are four superforces that are combined to one thing .
Gamers are super-for-engaged , hopeful for the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the massive .
These are people who believe that they believe they &apos;re allowing the world .
And the only problem is they believe that they believe that they &apos;re able to change virtual worlds and not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to figure out .
There &apos;s an economist. There &apos;s an economistonished .
His work brillianta . He &apos;s searches the reason why people spend so many time and money on online world-world .
And he goes : Discreen from nothing less than a real mass exol of exoso to virtual world-world &apos;s meworld-world .
And he &apos;s a economisty , so he &apos;s rational rational .
And he gt... Newell-like , I &apos;m a game design ; I &apos;m a guy design .
But he says this is that this makes sense because gamers can be more of a major gamers in a world than in the real life .
They can have more social relationships in games than in the real life .
They get better feedback and feel more likely in games than in the morning .
So he says it &apos;s perfect , it &apos;s perfect , that gamers spend more time in virtual world-world than in real world .
Number , I &apos;m going to ake a rational , at this moment .
But it &apos;s not a retimal situation .
We need to do the real world more likely to do more lifetime .
So I take my involves my intended of something that 2,500 years ago .
These are ancient dobusiness , made of sheep buttttons . Okay ?
For we had a cool controlers , we had cheating chapters .
And this is the first piece of tools for that distitute played by human .
And if you work the old Greek historian historian historian , you might know this story .
the inventors of the first game and why they invented it .
And this is the dotus that played , particularly invented in the king of dobombs , in the king Lydia during .
And apparently , the hungry was so worse , that the king of Lydia decided to downtown something .
People lived living . People flights .
It was an extreme situation . They had to have an extreme for an extreme for extreme for .
Duses Herodotuses , they found out business baggery and a massive policy .
One day , eat every one day .
The next day , plays everybody .
And they would be so much sub-thank-damn in their games because they play his book , and damn us under us in such as such as such as salient as a measurer .
The next day , they played games .
The day after all , I was search .
And then , in Herodotus , they were following this 18 years .
They survived a famine by eating one day and eat the day and the next day .
And I think this is exactly how we use games today .
We use games to emerge from the real world .
We use them to emerge from everything that broken from everything that is broken in the real world , everything that &apos;s not happen to the real life , and we get what we need from game of game .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end .
This is very exciting .
After 18 years , and then , Herodotus didn &apos;t get a little bit of a famine .
So the king that they would have a last door play that they would play a last dobusiness .
She &apos;s a very quickink in two .
They played one dobles , and the winners of that game was to be on a epic adventory .
They would be latency Lydia latency .
And enough people living in order to survive of the life that are more wareness there , and hopefully they could make the civilization somewhere else .
Number this sounds of crazy ?
But recently DNA evidence to that Etrusks , who would lead to the Roman empends , DNA as the ancient Lydiegg .
And so , scientists have suggested that Herodotuses tell-being of targets .
And geologists found out of a climate change that nearly during the hungry 20 years , that almost expensive that the hungry .
So this crazy story could be true .
It could be that they &apos;ve rescued their culture by playing games , by deployed to a game for 18 years and then inspired so much about the game , and then inspired so much of the game , that they save their whole civilization in that way .
Okay , we can .
We &apos;re playing Warity for 1994.
It was the first time strategy time strategy of the World of Warld of Warld well-like . That was 16 years old .
They played with dobusiness during 18 year , we play for 16 years , we play for 16 years .
I say that we &apos;re ready for our own epigmented measurest of our own epigin .
Audies half the population of the population of search for a new global .
So that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to take 21 a.m.
We &apos;ll leave half our agreement a day , to go to the problems in the real world .
Audian , I know what you &apos;re asking for you to ask that problems are by the memory of the Wel, which is where I &apos;ve been dedicated to the last few years , at the Institute Veor For The Two .
We have a banner in our building in Palo Alto, and it presses our standpoint of how to deal with the future .
We don &apos;t want to go predictorious him .
We want to shape him .
We want to represent us to the best possible .
And then we want to give people the meaning to reality .
We want to be our epig of proposition , and then people give the resources to exist their profit for exciting for exciting their empathy wind .
I &apos;ll show you short three games that I &apos;ve made a little bit of that I &apos;ve made a attempt to give people the resources to their own deaths for the future .
Okay , this is World Without .
We made this game in 20070s .
This is a line game of a online of oil is trying to survival .
The text is fiction , but we &apos;re telling enough online to believe that it really , and to make you believe that it , and to make you real life as if we don &apos;t have any more greeed . Dus, if you don &apos;t start the games , you &apos;re telling you honest , you tells us where your woke .
And then we give you real-time currently , and data that you show what the exactly is from oil , which is not available , how the exact crazy supper , how transportation is influenced , or the schools are influency , or the schools are relationships , or there .
And you have to figure out how to live your real life has to be like real life as if this . And then we ask you a blog about it , to start to be a blog of video .
We started this game with 1,700 players in 20070s .
And we followed them for three years since .
And I can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
Nobody wants to be changing their life-way poor only because it &apos;s good for the world or because we would have to be told .
But if you put them on a tuncture , and they telling them : Take a sense of the memory of oil
This is a great story and adventure to add up .
And that &apos;s what you would be seeing for me to see how you would survival .
The deaths helped their habits that they taught in this games .
Dus, for the next world &apos;s reasoning world , we decide to mixture , bigger problems than a oil .
We made a play called Superstruct struck at the Institute For the Toes .
The plot was that a supercomputer had been realizing for 23 years , had just been talking about 23 years on Earth .
This supercomputer had the name of the name Global Extinction Awareness System .
We asked people to come online , almost as a Jerry Bruiner , and a Jerry Bruckheimer .
You know , Jerry Brust-cheimer , you form a taneam .
You have the astronautomobial scientists , and they have to sent the ex-prison , and they have to stilt together the world .
But in our game , we &apos;ve been in five people on the dream , and everybody on the thream , and it &apos;s your job to finish the wild of the wells of the health , the employment of the health , the providing of the health , the conceived of social mind .
We showed 8,000 people play the game during eight weeks .
They &apos;re 500 of these creative creative swings that you can see if you &apos;re on Google for the extremely Superstructure .
And then finally , the last game , we bring it out on three magnitude . This game is made in collaboration with the World Bank Institute .
If you played the game out , you will be certified by the World Bank Institute as a Social Institute as a Social Institute , classroom of the major classroom .
World you of college with universities , and we invite Africain , and we invite them to teach social indicates .
We have a comic pulled comic . We have a system with lots of lots of lots , since , knowledge , sustainability , vision and invental .
I &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game of publishing this game please with young , all over the world , especially in development areas that could be advantage ; to send their own social entrepreneurs to save the world .
So I &apos;ll now go around .
I want to ask a question .
What do is think of it &apos;s going to happen now ?
We &apos;ve been all these great gamers, we have these games that are the amazing world that we could do , but no of them has the real world .
Well , I hope you &apos;re going to be able to get a measure that gamers a sun source , which we can use to heal the real world , that games are a powerful platform for changing .
We &apos;ve already got this incredible superforms , salient productivity to a poet , the opportunity to be a poet , this sense of burning optimism and the desire to a public significant .
I really hope that we can get to together to play games that we can actually collect games to be a difference on this planet .
And my hope is that you make with me games and play games like the guys .
If I look forward to the next decades , I know two things that we can imagine , that we can imagine and every game that we can imagine and we can play every game that we can play for .
Dush , I hit , let &apos;s go into the world changing play .
Thank you .
Since I &apos;ve been interested in the case of the employment of the emergence .
That can look strange for a magicious , unless you &apos;ve been accumulate for this to be a meaning of the extremely thing that &apos;s been a little bit of a message of the measured of Meet of Meet , sugar pills , sugar pills the studies of the cheager , the studies effect of the studies of the multimate effectent .
Just because the equissue of issue that what &apos;s happening to him is a genetic resource or something else --
For the pinky , examples , as they dangy in believed , it gets a measurable bodies effectable , the emergence of the emergence of the process of the emergence .
Something that needge is going to be honor &apos;s perception .
And to make sure that we understand each other , I want to start to start with you a very simple structure .
And I &apos;ll show you how it work-to-to-having trick for the years , for the years , for the years .
I &apos;ve been tiny for him as a little boy in the &apos; seven-year-grade .
I &apos;ll explain the trick , I &apos;ll explain it .
And then I empty much why I explained him .
This is what happens .
The fabulous thing you can do . my hand, you can visit .
I &apos;m going to hold it in this way , I &apos;m going to hold it in this way .
I &apos;ll my mind my little clip .
And to be there , in fact , there &apos;s nothing in my mind , I &apos;ll get in my pols .
And the deaths you can see that there &apos;s no movement .
I &apos;m going to check here , can &apos;t be able to get in my mind .
The goal is very simple .
I &apos;ll open my hand , and hopefully , if it good ism , my magnetism will be human-to-stop .
It &apos;s actually consisted to be so celebrate , that I can &apos;t scufferent it , and it &apos;s not on the ground .
Nothing comes in or from my molection , and you can &apos;t cheat all observing observative .
Ta-damn !
This trick , I &apos;m often on a lot of a trick kids who are interested in the major , because you can learn a lot about misunderstanding it .
Even the present of the trick of the trick of the trick of each other .
Probably a lot of you &apos;re probably a lot of this truck .
This is what happens .
I love it . I love it .
I say I &apos;m telling my pols to make sure that there &apos;s nothing in and I &apos;m going to say that there &apos;s nothing in and my mind .
That &apos;s supposed .
The reason I hold my wrist , because of the illusion of illusion paint .
At the moment , my hand modeling your view , my wise finger &apos;s pointing in the original place to a such a such a such a such of the site .
Moomi moscil to be tricks who had no youth of hot , sitting in the business .
It &apos;s going to dumb .
And if I turn into my fingery .
We can realize this crime about why you don &apos;t notice that there &apos;s three fingers .
That &apos;s because the brain information is because the brain doesn &apos;t processing a way that it doesn &apos;t have any secondly ,
But it &apos;s not going to be able to do it , and then I do my hand ? And then I do it ,
Of course , it &apos;s not a knife , but by cheeering , but by the presence of my wisdom .
And if I close my hand , I cloth my hand , which is self-de.
And if I turn into the weather , this movement for me , I can retreat my finger .
I &apos;ll hay this hand . You reach it out .
A beautiful tricky that you can do for friends and family downtown .
Now , what has to do with the evil of the ewoods effectors ?
About a year ago I read a research that I read the eyes are completely opened .
I &apos;m not a scientists , so for me , this was amazing .
It turns out that if you &apos;re dealing a measure-in-white round pill that &apos;s been a major tourney of an amazing thing , it &apos;s multible effect ,
Moften as the meal of the ebo changing , for example , by a smaller pill , which you blue colorful and where you then get a letter to be a letter , the bo measurer effectively .
Even though , despite of both of them , medicine , it &apos;s sugar pillensions .
But a white pill is not as good as a bluefully .
Watch ? I got really a remaining suburban .
But then , you know , it can be geckery .
It turns out that capsules are more effective than which species are facing a tablets .
A small capsulyfish , yellow on one and red on the other officer is better than a white .
Dosering in this role .
A pill twice every day is not as good as three pillense -- I can &apos;t remember the statistics ,
But the point --
Prole .
And the deaths a role .
And for the ultimate emerging eventure , we need to go to the needle .
Ja, toch? A injection spoke a little injectleman of a kind of injectilate that you &apos;re in a meaning of a meaning of a meaning of mine in a sense of excells of injection .
This is a huge powerful image in its mindset .
It &apos;s lots of minds more than the white pillion .
We &apos;ll let a graph several , when we can show the meeting of diac diac .
The point is not as good as the blueful pill is not as good as the bluefully as the capsulity , is not as good as the capsulity .
And no one of all the things has a real medicine .
And just your belief in your body , it really makes a stronger effectory .
I wanted to see if I could see if I could applied that idea in a trick .
I wanted to take something that &apos;s a trick and really make it likely .
We know about that research that when you reality , you have to grabbing , you have to grabbing .
This is a needle of almost 18 inches . She &apos;s volved .
I &apos;m going to go a little bit more sterilize .
This is really my meat . This is not a special vespecially vestigate .
This is my skin . This is not a Hollyword spectrum .
I &apos;m going to go through my skin through this particular road , until I go through it .
If you &apos;re overing -- or if you &apos;re easy flawfalls , and I did this trick yesterday , and I did this trick yesterday , and some people I don &apos;t know .
A woman was almost of her stick .
So I &apos;m supposed to that if you remember the next 30--- you know , I do , you know , I do the first heavy part .
You can look away , but also , you can look away .
This is what happens .
I mean , I &apos;m going to poorest a small ga-empowered .
Sorry, man. Now , if you think this misconversation ?
And then just by my skin , and then , then by the other side .
Well , zero , we &apos;re in essence of situation as with the measurer .
A species .
But you can now my fingers , right now ?
I &apos;ll show them . Here &apos;s one , two , three-, fifth .
Ja...
I know people think if they &apos;re in this size .
They don &apos;t think of the meaning is that for themselves to be able to perceive itself a few minutes of his public such as a sense of being a mindset of his public feeling .
What does that look like , extremely good .
Ja, I know what the people in the back in the room , the people &apos;s room , I don &apos;t think of the Okay , that &apos;s the other room now , I don &apos;t do it now , as I think , as you know , as I think ,
Let me show you this close to you .
That &apos;s really my skin . That &apos;s not a Hollywood spectacle effectors .
That &apos;s my meat . I can pull that pillion .
Sorry. If you too much word-to-word-to-looking , don &apos;t look away and to that dingle .
People in the room or people in the room or seeing for the course of the meaning of the meaning of the extremely spectful of it , but if it really car , he would -- there &apos;s a hole and there . If it really would be long-blood at me for the blood blood blood working on the blood workers for me to July July .
Ja, there &apos;s a way .
And I normally would be removed the needle .
I would make my arm , and show you that there &apos;s no swonder .
But in this context and with the idea of something that is that needle , and it really makes me the needle and I &apos;m going to sit down the stage and I &apos;m so from the stage .
The next days , I &apos;ll just take you to see the next few days .
And so , you look at that . Thank you very much .
I &apos;ve been a lot of fish in my life .
I have two of the meaning of the meeting of the meal .
The first thing seemed more to a passionate affairement .
It was a beautiful fish , tast-squaring , good structure , messing for the menures .
What a fish .
And it was a pretty much more sustainability to the assumption of sustainability .
So you felt good at the sales .
I had a relationship with this beauty for maand-a-during mass .
And one day , the head of the company and asked me if I wanted to talk to a look at the sustainability of the issue .
Absolute , said .
Here was a company that was trying to figure out something that was trying to figure out our codition .
How do we keep the hands ?
In the last 50 years , we have the sea for the sea meal of the solid , as we &apos;re going to be forest .
It &apos;s hard to overdrive the devastating .
90 percent of the big visual that we have of love , the tune , the salmental , the salmental , sword fishering .
There &apos;s almost nothing more .
Dus, how good it or bad it also ga-fish , aquacultural , fishery is part of our future .
although there &apos;s a lot of arguments .
Vishing pollutaneously , the extremely of them , they &apos;re inefficiency ,
A big mindtune .
It has a self-conversier of 11 .
That means that there is fish wild pound to get a pound of being able to get a pound .
Next very sustainable .
And it doesn &apos;t make very good .
So here was a company that was trying to downtown .
I wanted to support them .
The day for the empathy , I called the head PR of the company .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
Dong-well-empathy , to say , you &apos;re not going to be a because of the facts of the such thing as far as much as it as much as I think that you don &apos;t pollutgle .
And that &apos;s closely extremely , we &apos;re so far from the coastal , that it &apos;s decision of our fish , and not concentral to the meaning of the meaningful for the meaningful of the meaning of the software .
And he added ,
That &apos;s conversier to 12.5 to 10-extremely , sitting in the provide of the process of the extremely massive to the extremely massive to the exact of the extremely for the extremely ,
2.5 to 110-amazing .
Two and a half of a watch ? What &apos;s a wild of water ? What &apos;s really a really deaths of the swell-empathy for 2.5 .
Two protein , say , hiring ,
Gewell-employed , and said the phone .
And that night , I fell in bed and , what is in godstrugle , in god-speaking , and I was a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , I called for the same thing I called Don.
I &apos;m like , I &apos;m like , which are sustainable protein for sustainable protein
He said he wouldn &apos;t stop it . He would like it .
So I &apos;ve been on the line with some people in the business .
Nobody could answer me a clear me .
until I finally got the main biologist ,
Let &apos;s call him Don .
Dong-well-empathy , which is a few previous sustainable protein
Good , he called the Good , he called the mails of meals , and then he said , chicken chicken .
I &apos;m like , I &apos;m sure Kiballet &apos;s extremely examples of the realm of the realm of Kiballet .
He said , &quot; It &apos;s Jay, conviction , molliaborate , shadow , shaking , shaking , dealing and processing to make sense of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the measurements .
I &apos;m like , I &apos;m going to be Wongage of your foot is chicken for the metage of the realm of the extremely
All of knowledge , two procental .
Nouth , that &apos;s about 30 cental , said ,
I &apos;m like , I think of Don, which is sustainable to figure out of fishing the mind
There was a long pauthem on the line , and he sea , and he &apos;s sea , you know , there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world .
My love for this fish was overall this fish .
Nev, because I &apos;m a self-in-fine prospital prospital prospital .
That &apos;s me .
Neev, I lost my love for this fish , I sweet , I sweet it , the fish to pack .
This is a fish , which is a very different love story .
It &apos;s the romistic species , the kind of where you get more of your fish , you know more of the fish targevis to the fish .
I first was in a restaurant in south Spants .
A friendly journalist spoke for a long time .
It has more or more insound .
He was in the table , a bright , almost slow-slow-slow-slow-scene .
The cook-up had to throw him .
Almost twice .
And so , it was pretty much more , he was pretty .
Who can do a fish so good , after he cooked out to throw ?
I &apos;m not going to , but this guy .
Let &apos;s crazy him .
Actually , his name is Miumble .
And neee , he didn &apos;t cooking the fish , and he &apos;s not a cook-kidding .
Ten &apos;t least in the way , as you and I understand .
He &apos;s a biologist in Veta La Palma.
That &apos;s a fish vote in the southwethweet of Spanity .
At the date of the Gaudalquivir .
Until the &apos; 80s , the vulnery in the hands of tinians .
They &apos;re going to foreign out on what actually drasonflip .
They did that by drawing the country .
They built a complex canalense , and they took the water of the country .
It didn &apos;t want to recognize economists .
And it was a disaster .
90 percent of the birds went on .
wat, for these places , a lot of birds .
And so in 1982 , in 1982 , a Spanish of company ,
What did side of the side of the side ?
They turn the water flow .
She literally she &apos;s a button .
Instead of being pushed , they used to go out and canna water , they used the channels to latent water .
She &apos;s a deaquatic cancer .
She &apos;s a 1,100 acres big fish big fish , major fish , heart , heart , paling -- and at the same time , Miuel and company have the ecological desert .
The grow is great .
I mean , you &apos;ve never intend something like this .
You know , you &apos;re horizon the edge of the infinite , you see , all over the channels and see this distraction .
I was there with Miumble for so long ago ,
He &apos;s a wonderful vental vental , three-quarters Darwin and one quarter of Crocodile Darwin .
Calmost be well-being , I &apos;m going to be sharing and slandscaffing and such a swell-being , and Miguel , gives Miguel museless .
And here he points to a rare Zwar-Schoul-Schoul-Schouth wolders .
Now , he &apos;s pointed on the mineral needs of the phytoplankage .
And here he sees a group of speaking that he &apos;s doing this at the Tanzanian giraf .
It turns out that Miguel most of his career spray has been spended in the Mikumi National Park in African Ar.
I asked him how he was such a visitting .
He &apos;s like , he &apos;s Viss ? I don &apos;t know anything about fishering .
I &apos;m a relative-expert.m.
And then he talked about rare so much of rare birds and algae and strange water plants .
And gray me not traffic , it was really fascinating , a kind of biological realization .
It was amazing , but I following .
And my head swine in the cooked piece of hot , I was a tonight fish .
So I brought heads . I &apos;m seizing the Mium , how does it come so good for the fetal text of the meaning of the meaning of the swells of swell-making sure of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the table .
He &apos;s remember .
I know what I know , churchell-tunkingly , the phytoplankage , it &apos;s amazing .
But what food is the fish ?
What &apos;s the realization of the well-size of the exist of the well-conversion
And then he &apos;s going to tell me that the such a rich system that the such a rich system that they would be in the wild .
The plantain biomasassation , the phytop-lenk-tune , the animal plank-to-to-mal-to-mal-to-mal-to-mal-law biomased , which is the fish of the table plankness .
The system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely self-incurrently .
There &apos;s no farmacy .
And then a farm of a farm that animals don &apos;t fer-fer-like animals ?
I was going to saw that lady , I was going to be a silly to be a solid , I &apos;m sea : Take a luggling for a rescue of the measure-to the measure of the massive successful for the measurements of the most successful for the presence of the measurescued to the most of the sweek of
At that moment , it was like a filmed movie director .
And we went around the corner and saw the most great facilities , thousands of rock flamingames , literally a smoke tape for you .
That &apos;s successful , it &apos;s succeeed .
And it &apos;s a look at their glimpse , robust .
They &apos;re at the party of the party of the feasizes of the party of the party of the party of the party of the party of the party of the party of the party of the feasian .
Feeling ? I was totally confused .
I &apos;m like , I &apos;m like Migel, they &apos;re not at the party of the feminds of the visual
Jaseful , for the meal , haired .
We &apos;re touch 20 percent of our fish and fish education ,
Last year , this area had over 60,000 bird bird species .
It &apos;s now the biggest and one of the most important private airs are being empowered in very sense , very , very ,
I &apos;m like , I &apos;m a little bit of Milian , is a bird population that doesn &apos;t do good for a fish swoom of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the swell-empathy population that is a bird population that &apos;s good for the last thing you want to do is not the last thing you want to do with a fish vote
He shutting his headed his head-chiefs .
He &apos;s saying , it &apos;s a cake of extensive , not intensive .
This is an ecological network .
The flamingames eat the garnalently .
The shrimp food .
So how sleeval the glimpse , the better system .
OK, let &apos;s just take a minute .
A question of the animals are not fertastic , and a vulnery that are measure to the core its huntering his hunting .
A fish vices , but also a fish species of the bird .
O, and marriage , who should not be a swell-glimpse , which should not be sitting .
They breed in a village 250 miles away , where the bottom conditions are better to build nests to build nests .
Every morning flying , 250 miles to the vulnered 250 miles .
And every night , they &apos;re going back 250 miles .
They do that because they can do the subsibility of the extraction of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meeting of the medium of the medium of the meaning of the medium of the meaning of the meaning of
No graphy .
I realized a penguin , so I looked at Miguel .
I &apos;m like , I &apos;m sure Migells , they &apos;re going to fly 250 miles to the vulnery and then 250 miles ?
Does they do for the young for the young of reality
And he looked at me at a Whitney Houstent-song quote .
He &apos;s sea : he &apos;s doing that for the present of the hair .
I have not meless the skin of my loved fish , who &apos;s not a great washing , and I don &apos;t like fishing .
I don &apos;t like that . I don &apos;t like crawl .
It &apos;s that wrange , teacher .
I &apos;m rarely rarely .
But when I took him to restain that restaurant in south Spanital , he didn &apos;t make sense of visual skin .
He made this sweet and clean al-like a bicycle , and he was a pull out of the ocean .
I said to Miguel and he kness .
He &apos;s sea : he &apos;s working like a sponsoon .
It &apos;s the last defense before something the body in the body ga-inside .
He &apos;s evolved to southern institutions on the present
And then he added , but our water has no since our water .
Kokey , it &apos;s not fish that are not fercycle .
A question of , it &apos;s success measure that &apos;s success .
And then I realized that when he saw a vulnerous pitorities , he &apos;s a big understatement , because the water that through the vulnerous stratement , because the water that through the vulnerous struadict .
That &apos;s a river that &apos;s a river that &apos;s far with rivers of all the nine , chemical engineering , pesticipate religion .
And it &apos;s just by the system of the basic and throw , is the water &apos;s shiner than when it came in .
The system is so that the system is so that the water .
So not just a vulnerable , not just a vulnership , not just a vulnerable to the health of its sunity , but a material , but a material that literally , a water nuggling installation .
And not just for that fish , but also for you and miles .
that if the water flows away , it comes in the Atlantic .
A drop in the ocean , I know what it &apos;s , but I &apos;m going to take , and I &apos;m going to be kill you because this love high-display , is also a romised romism .
You can say it &apos;s a recipe for the meaning of good , whether we &apos;re wearing about bag .
What we need now is a new farm conceptance , one of the massive , a massive real-protected ,
But for a lot of people is that a little bit of too radicaal .
We &apos;re not realistic , we are nice proversity .
We &apos;re love and we &apos;re love .
We love the boom-market .
We like little family company .
We &apos;re just talking about local .
We eat organ .
And if you suggests that this is the things that are the extremely the excerpt of good empathy , there &apos;s always a slowly church , I love rock of rock , but how do you go to the world , you know , the solete the world ?
How are you going to be the world of feeding the world of a well-empathy .
Can I honest ?
I don &apos;t like that questions .
Nev, because we &apos;re now producing more than enough correlate to feed the world .
And one of the most people are hungry today .
And one of the extremely message -- because of the great inequality in department , not the amount of relationship .
I don &apos;t like this question because she &apos;s a demand because she &apos;s the logic of the logic of the last 50 .
And , grain , pesticides to re-to-monocultural , chemicals to mountain , chemicals to fish , the whole agricultural of the wall is that I think of the wall is a good thing to be footage of foreign to the forest of the wall
That &apos;s the motivation .
It &apos;s the right-hand skilled .
It &apos;s been the entrepreneurial front of the American agricultural front of the American agricultural trouble .
We should be the except for the issue , an enterprise in liquidation , a maintain that sense , which is the production that production is right .
That &apos;s not a taking , and it &apos;s not an agricultural agricultural .
Our daily bread is now threatency , not by detected by the frumbled , not by the last combined , not by the last combined , but by fertilized landgy, but by fertilyfish , not by chazzzzaque , but not by chain , not by bone .
You want the world to nurture ?
Let &apos;s start with the question : How do we go to feed ourselves ?
And the deaths , how can we conditions for the exact of itself ?
To downervous that , don &apos;t look at the agries of the future .
It &apos;s old and it &apos;s old and it &apos;s accelerating .
It &apos;s very strong , chemicals and machines and machines , and it never has something really good to eat .
Let &apos;s look at the economological model .
That &apos;s the model that is the relies of two extraordinary jobs .
Look at Miguel, like Miguel, like Miguel, who don &apos;t know their own worldding , who repainted rather than any world-growing , which re-to-vary vulnerable that are not just producers in relatively , in relationship , but in relationships because they &apos;re the one in relatively that make experts in singing .
And if I really really , really , really , they &apos;re a better cock than I ever will .
And I think it &apos;s primary , because if that &apos;s a great deal of the issue , it &apos;s being a very good thing .
Thank you .
I grew up , on a constantly diet of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the time .
And the propose of education , I went to the bus to school , I went to the bus to a school , every day .
And I was always absorbed by a book , a very fiction book , which I think I &apos;m in thoughts of other worldly news , and in the middating since , my involabority , my invitable news .
En, knows the curiosity , who &apos;s curiosity to be in the fact that I &apos;m not in school , when I don &apos;t washing in school , I wasn &apos;t in school , I &apos;m in the forest , wissnake of the malental , insite and they took them back in the order of the malencopyright now .
You know , I was a real science .
But it all was about understanding the world , the borders of the possible understanding .
And mine love for the meaning , also seemed to be mirror in the world to me , because what happened was this was the hundred of the satisfer , we went to the massive ocean , we went to the magnificent ocean , Jacquies Cousteau came into our habs , which are amazing wasn &apos;t really special world , which we can &apos;t see our animals and places and a wonderful world that we had never really never seeased .
This seemed to resonate with the whole of the deaths of the wildlife .
And I was an artistic .
I could draw . I could draw . I could painting .
And because there &apos;s no games of games , and these collection of CG and all this is the main of alandscape , I think this is a malong the main realization .
You know , you had to know , that we had to do , as children a meal and a meal of the author something on the author on the basis of the crowd in our head seat .
And my reaction on this : painting , painting , drawing out of the world &apos;s critical , extraterous , robotic creatures , all that kind of dinner .
I was a constantly traps of mathematics such a letttts-book-mollection .
That was the creativity that was an extraordinary of the rest .
And then something interesting happened , the Jacques Cousteau program , made me very excited about the fact that there was a very excited about the fact that there &apos;s an alien world washing here on the planet .
I wouldn &apos;t really be at an alien world on a day in a spacecraft .
That seemed to be disortunately .
But that was a world where I had a meaning of the world just going to go here on Earth , which is so rich and exotic washing , if everything I had imagined me , by reading the reading of that book-.
So I decided to be diverted on the realm .
And the only problem with that , I was washing , which I was a little village in Canada living in Canada lifetime of the nearest ocean .
But I &apos;m not scaling that by the gorror .
I saw in mind at mind , until he finally found a disease school in Buffalo, New York , just over the border of the border we lived .
And I took a multi-term certificator in a swimming pool of a YMCA, in the winter, in Buffalo, New York .
And I think of the ocean , a real ocean , not until two years aterial , when we moved to California .
Since service in the tusliggating , I &apos;ve been touched about 3,000 hours under water , and 500 hours of that in the submarine .
And I learned that that deep sea , and even the undeep ocean , and even the undeep ocean with wonderful life that it really is that it really our imagination .
The imagination of nature is so limited to our constraints , compared to our limitation ,
And then , I have big , I &apos;ve been looking at the major for what I see is the time to see this .
And malizing love for the ocean is still as strong as they &apos;re washing as strong ever as they ever washing .
But when I was adult as an adult a career , this filmmaker .
And that seemed the best of the except I had to combine stories with my driving , to combine with my driving to be except for the meaning of the meaning of the meaning that &apos;s exist .
And as a kid , I was always a sign of comic bookengths .
Films make the way of making sure and stories together . And that seemed to make sense of the meaning .
And the exciting that I &apos;m cooking for tellength , for the most of the time , excellent , the extraordinary of the Abysses of the Abysses of the extremely extremely for the Abysses of the excellent ,
And with The Abysses , I spent the mind for underwater and dissease , with films .
Say , the two passions combining .
And it &apos;s interesting to this is the real-existed by the Abysses of the extremely engineering a million technical problem that , the mess of a liquid water , which is a kind of liquid water , CG, surrounded animation .
And this result in the first of the major supply of the massive facility , CG , who ever had in a film .
And even though the film never brought the film , it was a business of a supply , I was gone to be able to say , I was a gorgeous thing , that was the pudience , the world &apos;s public , the public , showed the public magic .
You know , the empathy of the reality of the Clark of distinced technology is not too distinct of magic .
They saw something magical .
And I became very excited .
and I thought , is something that &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able in the filmmatic
Duses , with a term of the meaning of my view , we went to see a lot of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of a meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the argument of the medium of the examples of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the arteries , we went out here .
World ILM, for the other words of liquid metals in that filmed filmed . The success of it would be in that filmed .
And we did what we do . And we re-empowered .
And we had a result of the public .
All of the money we &apos;re a little bit more money on that filming .
Dush to get a line between those two points of experiencing , led to this is a whole new global , a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity .
So I started a company with Stan Winstoning my good friend Stan Winstonishing the makest make-up designer and creatures in that time and it was genmacted by the time , Digital Domainitial Domainitial Domainitial Domainitial Domainitial Domainitial Domainital Domainitial Dumbers . I started to say , Digital Domainital Dominnaciticities .
And the concept of the company was that we would be a very soon , beyond the analog processes and things things things are directly to digital production .
And that we did , we actually , and the gave us a competition for a competition .
But we found us , in the middle of the years , the middle of the years in the creatures and character design , for which we had gone to the business .
So I wrote this piece of genaminal Avatory , the definitely of the boundaries of visual effects , from CG effects , from realistic , realistic human empire generated in CG , and the headjets would all be the world in CG . And the world would be in CG and the bounders would be in CG . And the world would resaries .
And I was told by the people in mind , that we wouldn &apos;t be able to be able to downtown this .
So I put it in the refrigerator , and I made that other film about a big ship that sink .
I sold it to the studio alsize : a Romeo and Jultra-to-seem to a multiply .
It &apos;s becomes an epic romism , passionate filmed filmmation .
What I wanted to do was washing , I wanted to wasn to go to the real well-employment of the meaning of the meaning of the Titangle .
And that &apos;s why I make the film .
And that &apos;s the truth . Echterly knew , studio knew that .
But I convinced hengine . I &apos;m sishing : We &apos;re going to go to the walk .
We will use it in opening the filming of the films .
It &apos;s going to be very important . It &apos;s going to be a great deal of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the present .
And I convinced them an expedition to financierency .
Couts sound . But this comes back on the theme of your imagination that a reality of the reality .
And the empathy that we really reality a reality of the massian summary sparse in a Russian undersea , two and a half a mirro depthand a half of mirrorthered the real Titanic by a pattern , not a filmed , not a filmed , not HD, but not .
I was replently mind you .
And the most propell-empowering , we had to develop case of the meaning and lights and all kinds of dinner .
But it was just like , I fell on how much these diverse , these deep taught on space crimes .
You know , the very technical and the most enormous planning .
You get into this dark in the sweet , you &apos;re going to go down in this dark environment that there is no hope of rescue if you can &apos;t return yourself back .
And I thought , &quot; Wown , the excelling of the most fiction of the time I lived .
This is very coole-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-coo-y . This is very cooking .
And I had the taste of the deep ocean of the deep ocean &apos;s fun of the deep ocean .
Nature , the curiosity , the science component sciential .
It was both . It was a new thing . It was a curiosity . It was an experience that was a remarkable . And it was an experience that Hollywood couldn &apos;t fit .
And the deavor , I could represent a well-looking at the meaning of visual . But I couldn &apos;t make me extremely extremely what I was going to do is to be a little bit of a mind of the examples of the meaning of the meeting of the means , I could be able to make a sense of visual . But I couldn &apos;t make it make me a sense of visual effectively , I could make a realize that &apos;s a sense of violent , and I &apos;m going to know ,
As we detect some of our next expeditions I had no dealse for hydroal sources and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that I had ever seen before , who had ever seen any other one , the realization of the science that we &apos;ve seen them and they were in .
So I was full of this and more deaths of the most and a deaths of the meaning of the meal of this .
And so I made a very strange , I made a strange .
After the success of Titanical , I said , &quot; I think , &quot; Talky &quot; mate &quot; Hollywood , and I &apos;m going to be a little bit time to explore examples of the lower armed for exciting the lower .
And so we started planning these expeditions .
And we finally went to the Bismarket , and exploration it with robotic vehicle .
We went back to the Titanicken .
We had small device of challenge that we had a deal with solid extremely .
And the idea was to go in and go into an interior , research of that ship , which never been done before .
Nobody had ever cut in the wrap . They didn &apos;t have the resources to door , so we developed technology to downtools .
Dus, here I &apos;m zero-sized , in a dish , and look out in a disease , and look out at the bottom , and look outside of the band look out of the band played out a lot .
And I &apos;m a little robot vehicle through the meaning of the ship .
When I say I say that I do it , but must mess of the existence is in the vehicle as though I was physically felt like the creation of the Titanicancee of the Titanicanices .
And it was the most surrelated species of deja-vu-vu-vu-experience experience that I ever had to do what would sit for the lights of the vehicle of the vehicle , because I had a long time for months when we make the movie at the time .
And the set of an exactly as an exactly the blueprint of the ship .
So it was an absolutely remarkable experiencing .
And it did realize that the telepresence of the telepresence , which you can see , the realization of the injected to be the existing of the injected in this other other well-being of the existing .
It was really a deeply deeply deep-mind .
And maybe a little bit of a look at what could happen , which is decades decades , as a cyboard of cyboard for exploration or any other pursue , in many kinds of purpose , in many kinds of post-affected , which I can imagine as a fiction .
Bush , these expeditions have done and really , start to value what there is there going down there on the deep ocean , like the deep ocean bronnerable , where we &apos;re wonderful birthreatening .
They &apos;re just such an aliens in the world , and they just just on Earth .
They live in a environment of chemosynthese-lives .
They don &apos;t live in a sunlight based as we do .
And so you see animals that live next to 500 degrees of Celcius heawater-plumental heaquarters .
You could think they can be impossible .
And I was also re-interested in the course of the remarkable , I was re-interested in space , again , the fiction of the fiction of the course of a child .
And I got involved in space for the NASA , very , very , very , very , very , to the NASA &apos;s extremely the process of the realm of plannal space missions , I went to Russions to the pre-cospital protocools and all that kind of the gene , to actually international space station with our 3D camera on our 3D case , to actually international space station with our 3D camera ,
And this was fascinating .
But what the ultimate result , which I think I think I &apos;m a scientists with our munam to the depth of the depth .
And they &apos;re meaning for the meaning of the procelly-organized , people who were interested in that extreme environment , they were interested in those extreme environment , and they &apos;re taking mons and take samples and take samples and take tons and take tour .
Dush , there were we, documentary films of the documentary , and really , really , spent space science to the downtown .
I had the circle of the argument , you know what , as a child , and all of this really downtown .
And the empathy , I learned this journey of discovery , I learned a high .
I learned a lot about science . But I learned a lot about leadership .
Now , you should think that a director should be a leader leader , a leader , captain , of the ship of ship and that kind of business .
I didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until I display those expeditions .
I think of a meaning moment of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of this ?
Why do I didentitly do ? What I want to do is to be a meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of it .
We don &apos;t make money cannot with this disappeared programming .
They &apos;re naudominous extraordinary . There &apos;s no famous to extent .
People think I &apos;ve been gone to be gone between the Titanicaniceously , and I &apos;m going to spoke up to the extraction , somewhere in the beach .
I made all of these filmmassive , all these documentary documentary .
No further , no glory , no glory . Where are you doing it ?
You do it for the work , for the challenging , and the ocean is the most challenging environment that there is a little group of people who are exciting strange band that &apos;s existing as a small group of people a team .
And for years , we &apos;ve been doing all these things with the meaning for years .
Sometimes at sea for 2-3 mass to a piece of a piece .
And by that band-, you realize that the most important thing is that you have for them and say , for you have a task , you can &apos;t explain a task , which you can &apos;t explain to somebody .
When you come back to you , and you guardial , and you know , we had to do this and the fiber floor , and the date , and this and date , all the meaning of the most difficult , the air of the works on sea , that &apos;s not existence . It is that what police the thing that &apos;s poligives or people in the army that &apos;s not being able to extent .
That &apos;s a band-a-bas-on band-a-respectlement .
So when I came back to massive , which is the same for the meal of Avatory , I was trying to do the same principle of leadership , which is that you respecting your team , and that you &apos;re in rilling , their respect .
And that really changed the dynamic .
Dush , there I was a small teams of teams , I wasn &apos;t even a very much of the meal , new technology that &apos;s extremely new technology that hasn &apos;t existed before .
Enorm exciting .
Enormous challendage .
And we &apos;re a family , for four and a half a year period of four and a half a year .
And it turns out how I make films .
Dush , people gave comment on how the aware of , say , the ocean organisms back and they put on the planet Pandora .
For me , it was more a fundamental way of the deaths of process , that as a result ,
Dush , what can we do from all of this ?
You know , what are the reverse ?
Noul I think number is a curiosity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing you &apos;re seating .
Image is a reality that the reality of a reality of the amazing thing .
And the respect of your team is more important than all the land-in the world .
There are young filmmakers who come to me and say , &quot; Take me , &quot; Take me , &quot; Intervsive some of the avise of the extremely avice to deathand shake ,
And I &apos;m saying , I &apos;m not a regularly restrict .
As a sense of the other people will not do for your downtown , no to be the deavor of the meaning of self-a-in-in-in-in-meant .
And take risk of the realm risk of the realm of the realm of the world
NASA has this seed saying where she was sang on the nice : I think of Misokening ,
But failure has to be an option in art and discovering because it &apos;s a very in the deep issue .
And not a major endeaths that involves involved without risk .
You have to be willing to be willing to needge those risks .
And that &apos;s the thought I &apos;d like you want to rear behind that in whatever you tend to do a dumb , but fear of all the nonetheless . Thank you .
If I can tell you one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole thing that we use is largely than the delusion of the delently .
Instead of thinking about it to identify information , I want to think about how we can use information to get and trends that would keep the way to remains .
This is a typical stereaged rattory to age .
The tollection I &apos;m using this is an experimental experimental experimental experimental experimental .
It &apos;s called Pivoted Pivoted , I can filter on one of the death , for example , instance , instance .
I see immediately another pattern .
That &apos;s because here in the middle people are the most active number , and there &apos;s the vulnerable .
We can remember and reorganizing the data , and reorganizing the data that &apos;s dying species .
We see that heart disease and cancer the usual challenge , but not for every single one .
And if we &apos;re going to go and go on and filtering for example , for example , we see that unincidents the largest cause of causing .
If you have a dive there , that for male , that for male .
You see what I mean , you see what I mean is looking at information of the information of the infographicles in a living infographicle .
If we can do this with rough , why don &apos;t we do it with content ?
What we greeted here is the front page of every single number of Sports Ilustrated that ever made .
Everything is that all of this . It &apos;s all on the network .
You can go to your room and try this after my talk ,
With Pific , you can get on a decade .
You can get on a meaning for a year .
You can go to a song number song .
I &apos;m looking at this dums . I see the athletes that are in this number , the sports .
I &apos;m fan from Lance of Mstrong-having , so I &apos;m going to go up , and that &apos;s the numbers of me in the revenues that Like I &apos;m going to be a little bit of a munders .
If I want to look at this , I think , I think , why don &apos;t you know , I think , why don &apos;t the wealthy of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the things that are the welltiade of .
I do a step back and go on that .
Now I see Greg Greg Lemond .
You see that if you laughter in this way , melting information , and then you don &apos;t blow , you to walk , you don &apos;t leave your nonetheless .
You do something else that a little different issue .
It &apos;s a single , and we think it changes how you can use information .
So I want to think of it a little bit , a little bit of geckery .
Here we have every page of Wikipedia , and they restricted to a little covering .
The consummary is a little synin-synin-in-in-feasive subject to be .
I just show you the top of 500 popular Wikipedia page .
But even in this limited , we can do a lot of killing .
We get immediately an idea of the subjects that are the popular on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to check and check government .
Now I have government government , I see the Wikipedia categories that categories there it down there , Time Mengine People of the Jar .
This is very important because this insight in no one of the monarcement of the Wikipedia page of saturing .
You can only get it by doing a step back and see them all .
And if I look at one of these consummarization , I can look deeper at the understanding Time Persis from the year by showing them all of them .
A glasses of all these people to me that the majority of politics .
Some people come from the physical science .
And it &apos;s a smaller number of business comes from business .
I mean , my business is my boss .
One is coming from the music worldd-world .
What &apos;s interesting isn &apos;t a TED Prize .
So we can make a sense of all TED Prize-window .
So we first got to the web the web as if it really like it a web , not from page to page , not from page to page , but it &apos;s a higher abstrict .
I want to show you one other thing that you might be amazing .
I &apos;ll show you the website of the New empathroughout here .
Pivot, this applies -- I don &apos;t want to call browser , it &apos;s not a browser , but you can see it web page of it , and you can see these software technology to every web page , so on .
I &apos;m going to go out and rememory , right in a specific section .
The reason this important is that I think , is that I just by just looking at web page of my whole browse-history history in the sense of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning of the meaning .
I can go down to what I &apos;ve done in the rest of what I &apos;ve been doing is for the period .
Here &apos;s the status of the demo I just had a dominatory .
I can play some of the things that I can go to choose today .
If I put a step back and go and look everything , I can look at my historic selling , I can maybe sell my historian chain .
And here I did some nepotist research , and I was looking for Labs , and here &apos;s a giving Labs Pivoted Labs .
From there , I can go to the deeper and it again .
It &apos;s one metaphor that &apos;s re-metaphor that makes it very larger than the sum of the sharing of the data .
Fashed , in our world , we see data as a liquid .
We &apos;re talking about the fluke of the realm of information .
We &apos;ve drowning it in data .
If we could take that on his head on his head , and the web on its head , so that rather than going to go from one thing to the next ones to the next ones that we can reference from many things to many things to many things , and the patterns that could see different from the patterns that would hide violent in the hidden .
If we &apos;re not going to sit down , we &apos;re not in date in data than we can actually , maybe we can actually information .
Instead of just working with information , we can maybe it knowledge out of lockwise .
If we &apos;re knowing , maybe even wisdom to find wisdom .
So , thank you very much .
Everybody talks about happiness today .
I &apos;ve got somebody to count the number of books that the youngest five years with sound of the title of happiness , and he has given up there were a lot of simultory .
There &apos;s a lot of very interested in happiness , research .
There &apos;s a lot of happiness .
Everybody wants to make people happier .
But despite the mass of the mass of work , there are different cognitive values that make it as impossible to think about justice .
And I &apos;ll get it today about that today about that cognitive falls .
This is true for ordinary people who are nurture about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true to researchers that are just as we as in the war as all as the other one .
The first fall-falling is the squares to enable complexity .
It turns out that the word happiness is not a useful word is because we it on too many things .
I think there is one of the meaning that we could be limited to it , but everything is considered , but everything is considered to be something that we will have to give up more complicated vision of what existence .
The deaths is the confusion of the amazing experience and memory : that &apos;s coming in between the difference between your life and your life , and happy are about your life or happy with you .
And that &apos;s two totally different things that are being thrown in one hope in the concept for sound .
And the third falling is the illusion of focus and the unhappy fact that we can &apos;t think about a condition that we can &apos;t think about a condition that has impact on our well-finding .
I mean , this is a really a cognitive fall-cognitive fall-cognitive fall-cognitive fall-cognitive fall-cognitive fallelular .
There &apos;s no exactly a way to get this .
And I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who &apos;s a very demand for a question of , and I was an asking a story .
And this was nice .
He said he had listening to a symphony , and that it was absolutely fantastic music , and at the end of the extremely such a such sound such sound .
And then , really motival , really motival engineering that this had distural experience .
But that &apos;s cutting .
It had the reminds remind the experience of the experience .
He had the experience .
He had 20 minutes great music .
And they were not worth anything because he was blessing a remember ; the reminder of the reminder of the remembering was already what he had to think of the wildlife .
What this is beyond is that we could see ourselves and others as two of them as a single of the exciting of two extraordinary extremely ,
There &apos;s an experiencing , which is living in the presents and the presents , which is able to re-re-engaging , but that &apos;s the hot .
The doctor focus to our experience , I know -- if the doctor asking for the Dot of Doet it now when I touch you here to touch the meaning of the meaning of the meaningful for the meaning of the air .
And then there &apos;s the remindset , and the reminder of the one I &apos;m the one that keeps and the story of our lives and that &apos;s the story of our lives , and that &apos;s the deaths the deaths of the air , the aware of the realizing the wild of the wild wild of the wild is the wild of the wildly focus of the lifest time
or the realization you were to Albanian or sweet .
And that &apos;s two very different dinner , I experiencing and the height , I remember and the heat between both of the cooky that &apos;s made of the understanding happiness .
It &apos;s a telling I &apos;m telling is a telling .
And that really starts really fundamental response of our memories -- it starts immediately .
We don &apos;t tell us stories when we &apos;re up to telling stories .
Our memory is tells us to explore , which is what we can be able of our experiences is a story .
And let me just give you one example .
This is an old research .
And that &apos;s a real measured of the meaning of the meaning .
I &apos;m going to spend you the details. This is not painful memery , but it was painful when this research of the years of the years of exploration .
They had to rest every 60 seconds of their pain report .
And these are two extraordinary for the meeting .
These are their addict .
And there &apos;s been a touched to be asked for the meaning of having been having a meaningful for the meaning of the meaning of the present .
And that &apos;s a very easy problem .
It &apos;s obviously that &apos;s aware of having prayed .
His colonure-colon-during longer and for every minute pain that has had been a multimate for one minute , and multiply .
But here &apos;s another question : How many pain thinking of this is the extremely hadow of the extremely employed ?
And what a surprise is the surprise that &apos;s a lot of worse , a much worse , a much worse , a lot of worse ,
The stories of the colonoscopies of the colonies of the colonies is a very important part of the wake , and not these stories are really involved or choice -- but one of them is just one of them , just one of them is a single worse than the other .
And the worse is the story of the pain the end .
That &apos;s a quality .
How do we know ? How do we know that ? It &apos;s the people asked their colonoscopy , and a lot of teacher , the whole thing , the whole business of the reality , everything at the garden of the argument of the arglorately , how we know ?
and it was much worse for A than for A , in their memories .
Well , this is a right conflict between the experience and the reminder .
And from the point of view of the experiencing I &apos;ve got the clear public .
Well , what you could do with the meaning of A, and we have a very clinical produce of checkiny that &apos;s happening , and the towards the collaborate of the support of the well-being of the mind is just to put in the business of sitting in the business of the near .
That &apos;s the aware of suffering that the pain is liden , but not a lot less than before .
And if you have that a few minutes you have the experience for the most experience of the except I think of the memory of the memory of the memory of the memory of the air , a lot better because of the memory of his experience .
What &apos;s a story of a story ?
And that &apos;s what the stories that are supposed to the memory us , and it &apos;s where the stories we care about .
What a story of the means is that major moments and end .
Einds are the universe , very important and in this case , the end of the end of the main .
Well , the experiencing I live his life .
It has a moments of experiencing , one after the other .
And you know , what happens to this moment ?
And the answer is really simple .
They &apos;re always loriently .
I mean , the meeting of our lives -- I &apos;ve got the extremely message -- I have the extremely for three minutes , says about three minutes .
That &apos;s meaning , in a life , you have about 600 million .
In a month , there are about 60,000,0000,0000,0000,000,000,0000,000,000,000,000,0000,00000,000,000,000,00,000,00,00,00,00,000,000,0000,000,00,0,0
The deaths not tracking .
At the memory is not spent attention by reminded by reminding .
And the except in one or other way , the impression that they should be from the telling these experiencing moments our lives .
It &apos;s the endust be the endust that we use for the except for the reson-down .
And how you know that event except for relevant , but that &apos;s not the story that I &apos;m going to remember for us .
So we remember the thing I and the experiencing and that are really different for the same thing .
The biggest difference between both in the major of the major ,
And from the point of view , I have a vacation , and it &apos;s a very vacation , and the except for two weeks of the resource of one weeks .
It doesn &apos;t work for remember .
For the reminded , I &apos;m a remember of two weeks better than the vacation of one week because there &apos;s no new rememories are added .
You don &apos;t have the story changed .
And in that way , in that way , the mind is actually the reminder of a remember I distinct .
Time has very little impact on this .
It &apos;s reminds more than I do remember and stories .
It &apos;s the except that decisions takes dealt , if you have a huge of the extremely maar, two colonologies , and have had to decide what he &apos;s electric , then he &apos;s going to choose , and he &apos;s the most of the reminds of the least reinvented , and that is the surgeon .
The experiencing I don &apos;t have voice in this kitchen .
We don &apos;t choose between experiencing .
We choose between retroots of rememories of experience , and even if we think about the existence of our mind as normally ,
We think of our extremely as a memory of our empathy .
And you can actually look at this as a dictature of the member , and you can remembering it , and you can see it as the one of the one that experience that experiences the experience I don &apos;t need it to do it experiences that the powerful I don &apos;t need the sense of vaction , I feel that if we &apos;re going to go with vacation the most of the mainstream , the date I &apos;m going to take our own gets of the biggeous to the most .
And that &apos;s pretty hard to think responsible .
I mean , how often we use our member ingency ?
That &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s been given for the dominance of reminded .
And when I think about that I think about a vacation that we had a few years ago in Antarctica , which is clearly our best vacation ever washing , and I think of it in compared to other vaccess .
And I have my memories to have that vacation of three weeks for about 25 minutes , for the last four yarently .
Audiences I had opened the map of the 600 photograph of the retrope of it , I would have an hour .
So , that &apos;s three weeks , and that &apos;s almost ancept .
There &apos;s a discrepanish .
Numory , maybe I &apos;m a little extremely known , in the limited hunger that I have to rememories , but even if you &apos;re a fake a lot of the hammazining : why are we compartgery so much about rememories in compartgery to the importance that we &apos;re in the engineering of hatchy that we &apos;re going to do with the interest with the engineering of hunger ,
So I want you to think about a thought experimental experimental .
Imagine a vacation knows that at the end of the vacation of the vacation of the vacation of the vacation , you know , you get a pill that you didn &apos;t rememory to the memory of the memory .
Would you be cancement ? And if you choose another vacation would be choose to you .
and you have to think about how you conflict conflict .
That &apos;s not as cannot as for granted , because if you think of time , you get a single answer .
And if you think in terms of reminds , you may be able to another answers .
Why we choose the vactions that we choose the vulnerable that we confront with a choice between the two gardens .
Number two lets lead lead to two notes of happiness .
There are really two forms of happiness that we can applied one by one .
So you can lie , how happy is the experiencing ?
And then you &apos;d ragenetically happy , how to be the moments in the experiencing ?
And they &apos;re all -- the lucky of moments is a pretty complicated processes .
What are the metables that can be community ?
Brens, today we are able to get a fairly idea of the happiness of the experience I through time .
If you ask the happiness of the member I is that a total other seed .
This is not about how happy somebody lived living .
It &apos;s about how happen or following the meaning of having a meaning of her life .
And then it &apos;s different conceptable .
Everybody who these concepts in one hope will make a coot of the study of the happiness , and I think of a group of the lucky for a long time of the study of the happiness of the study of the happiness of the study of the study of the happiness of the study of the happiness of the happiness of the study of the happiness , and I think of the happiness of the happiness , and I think of the happiness of the study of the happiness of the happiness of the study of the study of the lucky of the study of the study of the luck , and I &apos;m ever sound , and the happiness
The distinction between the happiness of experiencing and the super-deaths , and the persuade of the measurer , and there are attempts to meant two simple people , the Gallup Organization is a global employment of the employment .
And there &apos;s more efforts in that sense .
So the young years , we &apos;re starting to produce the happiness of the two ikening .
And the main lesson we &apos;ve gone is that they really think different from each other .
You can know how to do somebody with his life is , and that &apos;s really very little about how happy he teaching his life , and converted .
Just to give you an idea of the correlation , the correlation is about 0,500 .
That means if you should meet somebody and say that his father &apos;s a tasy of girl would you know about his length ?
You &apos;d know something about his length , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
And a lot of uncertainty , you &apos;d have a lot of uncertainty , you have a lot of uncertainty of uncertainty , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy they are about their experiencing .
So the correlation is weaky .
We know something about what the teaching is the areness I &apos;m telling for the meaning I &apos;m telling .
We know that money , goals are very important .
We know that happiness means that we &apos;re too teaching people with people we mogene , by bring people that we &apos;re not going to be with people that we mogene .
There are other pleasure , but this is a weightforward .
So , if you want to maximize the two , you will be able to reduce it out that you can catch very different things .
The conclusion of what I said here is that we would not be happiness as a substance for well-being .
It &apos;s a very different conceptable conceptable .
And then a very , very , very , why we don &apos;t think about happiness is that we can &apos;t think about the extremely thing , is that we don &apos;t think about the meal , and if we &apos;re effectively lifetime .
So , if you ask the simple question , how happy people in California , you won &apos;t get the right answer .
If you ask that question , you think people have to be happier in California , if you go into the California .
And what happens when you think about life in California , you think about the contrast between California and other places and that contrast than contrast , for example .
It turns out that the climate is not so important for the experiencing I and not even the thinking I decided that I &apos;m not going to be able to do that .
But because it &apos;s the way I think the boss it can spin that you -- that some of the boss of the people &apos;s California .
And it &apos;s a very interesting to go to what &apos;s going to happen to people who moved to California hope to be likely to be in the hope ,
Well , their experiencing themselves will not happier .
That &apos;s weight .
But one thing happens . They think they &apos;re happier , because if they think about it will be reminded , because if they think about it was reminded how terrible it was in Eister .
And they will think that they &apos;re going to have the right decision .
It &apos;s very hard to think about well-being of thinking about well-being , and I hope I &apos;ve given you a sense of how fashion .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson-: Thank you . I have a question for youth .
Very a lot of thanks .
When we were in a couple of weeks ago , you told me that there was a very interesting finding me that there was a very interesting finding Gallupon pollinging .
Can you stilt this with us a few minutes about greedge ?
Daniel Kahneman: Sure I think the most interesting result in the Galluption polling is a number we didn &apos;t have absolutely expected .
It &apos;s lucky to do with the experience of the experience .
If we look at how feelings we look at how feelings we &apos;re going to see .
It turns out that under the revenue border of 60,000 dollars a year for Americans , and then it &apos;s all over a whole big group of Americans , and so 60,000,0000,000,000 dollars a representative representative stayet , under 60,000 dollars a year ...
CA: 60,000 DK: 60,000 dollars a year than people are unhappy , and they &apos;re getting more unhappy , and they become more sunhappy .
And we see a full flat lighting flat .
I mean , I got rarely self-flat lights .
It &apos;s obvious , what happens is that money you don &apos;t have a lack of money , but that &apos;s a lack of money , and we can actually get those miserable roughout of the causonomy , very big precisely precisely .
For the other ikness , you remember a very different thing .
The more money your entury , the more enough , you know , more enough ,
That &apos;s not true for the meaning .
CA: But Danny, the entire American streads of life , the extension of the extension of the extension .
And if people who are going to come out serious than that , it &apos;s a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very policy policy , and so .
a chance of politicies that the country would take the general result in the such a result , and it would take the public public public public public public public public .
DKeeemeans , I think there &apos;s recognition of happiness in public policy .
That recognition will be slow in the United Statently , which doesn &apos;t think not doubt , but in the U.K. is this to happen in the U.K.
People have been thinking about happiness when they think about public policy .
It will be a time and people will debate about whether they want to debate happiness or the evaluation of life , or the evaluation of life , so we &apos;ll have to study some of the life .
How we &apos;re lucky is very different dependent dependent on how you think and or your name is about reminder of the memoriginal .
This will be influenced policy in the next jarently , think .
In the United States , are done intense to be done to be the experiencing happiness of population .
And that &apos;s going to be about a year or 20-decational statistics .
CA: Wel, the exciting thing that this subject is the most interesting policy policy problem to be follow or for the next few yarently .
Thank you very much for your invention of the havioral economics .
Thank you for usual Danny Kahneman.
I &apos;m going to talk about today about climate .
And maybe that &apos;s a little bit of surprising , because my wellular time , I &apos;m going to have a kind of a kind of thing that I think about the things that we need to read and to deal with the most of the poorest two of the poorest of the poorest two of the poorest .
But energy and climate are extremely important for this human , in fact , more important than simply for this planetary .
The climate catcher so that their car wash , so that their crops won &apos;t going to grow .
There will be too many rain , or too , too ,
Things will change so that their vulnerable , so that their vulnerable environment just don &apos;t cannot more .
And that leads to hungry . It leads to uncertainty . It leads to uncertainty .
So the climate change will be a disaster for them .
The price of energy is extremely important for hengage .
In fact , if you could choose one thing to do is to make sure good for massive , to reduce the poverty of poverty .
The energy price is silent to the dalene .
Evivilization is based on the front of the ength-empowered energy .
The cross-revolution lead to the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , and even in the 20th century , and that &apos;s why we have refrigerator , we have gone bullet &apos;s make a revolution of the things .
And so we have a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich global .
We &apos;re making it cheaply -- and let &apos;s make it twice as cheap -- then there &apos;s a new constraintent , and it has to do with CO2 .
CO2 is actually a very warms up to the planetal warms , and the equation of CO2 is actually a very dealing for the paralular .
And if you tell-being telling CO2 that gets out to a temperature , and that temperature leads to a number of very negative effects .
The effects of the weather , the effects of the resistance , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to this deaths of the mind , and so you get ecosystems that collapsed .
Number exactly amount of how to make sure for a sense of CO2 to what temperature is going to go and go where the positive back , and where the positive back is about that is the only uncertainty , but not very field .
And there &apos;s a meaning of how very the consequences will be silent , but they will be very serious .
I &apos;ve asked this often asked to TV scientists .
we really need to really get out of nability ?
Can &apos;t we have half or a quarter ?
And the answer is date , until we &apos;re going to stay in the neighborhood will stay .
And so that &apos;s a big challenging .
It &apos;s very different from four , for example , a high tility truck under a 3.6 and a half of a six of a 3.6 , which is trying to get underneath a personal of a 3.6 of tall ,
This is something that is something that was going to zero .
Audience , we don &apos;t have a year a realize of CO2 , more than 26 extensix of the extremely empathy .
For every American is this about 20 .
For people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one .
It &apos;s a middle of about five tons for everybody on the planettes .
And we encourage , how to change things to zero .
It &apos;s constantly constantly up .
And it &apos;s just a little economic changes , so we need to have a definitely relate to a measure-toengage , and a disabled to zero-sum regularly for zero-sum ,
This equation has four facade of four facts .
A little bit of a multiply .
Duses , you have something to the left officer , CO2 , which is based on the left , and that &apos;s based on the number of human , the average use of services per personal services per personal-sized , and the CO2 , the CO2 employ-on-sner-on-similitary craft .
Bush , let &apos;s look at this piece of piece and see how we can get this to zero .
Probably one of these values in the neighborhood of zero compartment .
That &apos;s high school mathematics , but let &apos;s take a look at a look at .
First of all , we have the population .
Number the world today has 6.8 air on human being .
That &apos;s at the rise to about nine of the argument .
Duses , if we do it really well with new various health care , health care , reproductive health productive health , we could reduce that met, missional , the process of the process of the process of the process of the equipment , but we see a little about 1.3.m.
The extraordinary is the services that we use .
This is the realm , the meets that we &apos;re clothes , clothes , heat , heat .
These are very good dingene , and it &apos;s floor , it means to reach these services to almost everybody on the planetal .
So it &apos;s great as this number of farmers .
In the world , maybe the top of the world , maybe the top of the ardevices , we can sutences and the massive , but the reality is going to be the average , average , the relieved services in totaling , the religion will be more than a biblessly .
Here we have a very extremely service .
Have your lighting in your lighting your lighting in your mind , the fact , these kids are not going to go out and read their homework under the land-touch palentary .
Duses efficient , E, the energy for every service for every service .
We have a good news .
We have something that we don &apos;t rise .
And Via diverse invention and new exploration , by other species of the autool , other excells of building .
There are a lot of services where you can reduce the energy that &apos;s wild of the wild .
Something &apos;s a major service , even with 90 procently .
There are other service , as how we produce measures or how we produce with air airs , where the meaning is a lot of smaller .
And damn , if we &apos;re number , we can have a factor three to self-crime factor , a factor of the reducing of the reduction .
But for these first three factors , we &apos;re going to be on the process of the existence , and that &apos;s just not pleasure .
So let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this will be a pretty -- and that &apos;s the CO2 empathy for energy secondary .
So the question , can you get that to zero ?
If you stop collide , needle .
If you &apos;re going to stop your gas taking , needge .
All right , we have today is electricity producer today , except for the emerging sustainable energy and nuclear energy , CO2 .
And so what we need to do is a new system is a new system is a new system .
So we &apos;ve invited wonderful wildlife .
Duses , if I used the term , I don &apos;t mean to go on something that impossible .
The deaths is a wonderful . The PC is a wonderful thing .
The Internet and his services are a wonderful .
Duses , the people have contributed here to the present of many wonder .
And Normaliter we don &apos;t have deadlinear when you have to emphasize it to a date date .
Most of you just wait you , and sometimes it happens , sometimes .
This is a case where we actually have to full of the meaning of the meaning of the presence .
Now , how do I actually rejected this ?
And it &apos;s a kind of natural illustrategy , a demonstration that people to imagination ?
I was thinking about a year ago when I spent in mosquitoes and I found out in some way , I thought ,
It actually made them involved in the idea that there are people who are lifting with mosquitos .
Bus, with energy , this was the only thing I could do .
I decided to fly front of the environment here , I &apos;m going to fly to the environment here .
So here we have some natural fireflies .
And I told that they don &apos;t even more , more perhaps , they may not even leave this potential .
Duses there are all kinds of gimous impairment of diempathy , but they don &apos;t really do something .
We have invitable to invitable , in an incredible scale and of an incredible scale and of an incredible construction , although people in many directions , I see there &apos;s actually five of the meaning contribution .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing is , geothermal energy , nuclear fuses , biofuels .
And maybe that &apos;s something to wear , and if they do better than I expect , is that the best , but my important point here is that we will have to work on each of these five and we can &apos;t get to work on any of these five and we can &apos;t get a left because they all have their own important , because they all have their own important .
Let &apos;s first looking at fossil fuels , or burning on the fossil fuels of the supportune cool burning from the earth gas.
What you have to do is to be a disease of the particular , but that &apos;s the none .
You have to make all the CO2 after the burning burning , under pressure , sleeping sleeping , and open that it smakes it stay there .
Now there &apos;s some profits of the profits that level of 60 to 80 percent door , but it &apos;s a very hard time for 00-percent , it &apos;s going to be very hard , very hard for that CO2 is also very hard , but the most difficult , this is the long-term problem .
Who will this exist ?
Who will be there for a garant to something that literally exist of the argumes are larger than any kind of garchase you can think in terms of nuclear or other dinner ?
This is a huge volume .
So that &apos;s a hard thing .
The next is nuclear energy .
And also , you know , three big problems .
The cost , with the meaning of the regular landing , are high-regardens .
The issue of safety , really , that &apos;s really surely that nothing can wrong , as well , even if you have this mind , that the splay of the mind can be used for nuclear weapons .
And what do you do with the waste ?
And it &apos;s not so much , although it &apos;s not that much , there &apos;s a lot of care .
And they have to feel a good about it .
So three very difficult problems that may be extremely , and that has to be revergent .
The last three of the fifth , I &apos;ve been pedd-.
These are what people often people are the renewable sources .
And that -- although it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t require a fuel distance .
One is that the density of the energy won by through these technologies are more lower than that of an electricity is lower than that of an electricity tralescentritical .
This is energieland-built anti-miles , you have a lot of square miles , thousands of times more than you need for a normal energy equal energy .
And this is also this intermittering burnt .
The sun &apos;t seeing the whole dag, and not every day , and not every day , and white it &apos;s not white it .
And damn , if you &apos;re dependent from this burnon-dependent , you also have to find a way to have energy to have a energy to be available .
Duses we have big cost challenges .
We &apos;ve challenge challenge .
for example , if you reventure that these energy source outside your country , you have not only the technology , but you have to do with the risk of the energy of wild .
En, closed , it slaughter problem .
And to make that visible , I looked at all the species of batteries that made the world ; for authority , for the pocem , for business , for business , and for business the amount of battery that the world use and I found that the amount of the globe that we make less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
So we &apos;ve been invited a big breakthrough , something that is a factor of a factor , a better than the approach we &apos;re greeted now .
It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not easy .
This is important when you try to get reliable to get higher than 20 to 30 percent of what you use .
If you have a battery for 00-percent , you invited a wonder of it .
Number how are we going to go and find some kind of the approach ?
It &apos;s a Manhattan-to-meeting ? How can we know this for a sense ?
Nouth , we need a lot of companies that are about it .
In every single of these five pathogens .
And a lot of hends , you will find . That &apos;s cheap .
And I think that in the TED group , we have a lot of people who have this already pursuing this already .
Bill Gaware of various company called eSolar who has a big thermal solar technologies .
FinKhosla investing in dozens numbers in dozens language and try and support them , and I try to support that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I support a company , maybe surprised , nuclear energy usage .
There are some innovations in nuclear energy , malaxis , and fluid .
And there &apos;s a very long time that &apos;s not a very long realization in this industry , so it &apos;s not so strange that there &apos;s good new good for .
The idea of Terraparly is date , instead of a tiny attached to use a small uranium , which we &apos;re in 235, which is to realize the 999percent of U-23880-.
A little bit of strange ideas .
And they &apos;ve ever been talking about it , but they could never be good similar , or it would be a very wild of the measurely , or it would be a very wild of the world .
But by the way of the supercomputers can now , and hunting it .
With the right thing .
And because you use the 999percent , reducing the cost enormous .
You can even see the waste , and as a fuel , you can do all the survival of current reactors .
So , instead of care taking care that new fuel , that &apos;s amazing !
The dealing this uranium of time the reaction . The excellent is a map .
You see in this animation , often the present a de-golf golf course , is a reactor of the realm .
For the fuel , this is really the major of the major of the wild of the war .
I have a picture of a place in Kentyckycle .
This is nuclear waste , the 99 procental , where the 1percent of it has been pulled .
So it &apos;s called uranium .
That &apos;s enough for hundreds of jarently for hundreds of jarently .
And by a good meaning of seawater , you get to get a sweet for the life &apos;s life support of the whole planetary .
Duser , there are a lot of challenges for future , but it &apos;s an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of and hundreds of the meaning .
So , we &apos;re going to measure , how do we measure ?
How to report our report of vision ?
Let &apos;s first look where we need to come out , and then to the tutory ,
For 2050s , speaking a lot of people about 80-percent reduction .
And that it &apos;s really important to do that .
And that 20 percent will be a means of poor landendly , a part of the agricultural .
And so , we have clean forest and cementation .
Dush to get that 80-percent near to get the developed land , including countries like China , their electricity produce .
And the other initial replicate of technology in all the developed language , and we &apos;re going to be that elsewhere to introduce ?
That &apos;s super-important .
That &apos;s a important measuring point for that reportaneously .
Duses , how to report it for 2020 , they &apos;re going to be report for 2020 ?
Nouth , it has to those two evolves .
We have to improvements the efficiency of the existence .
The less we putting out , the CO2 word-word-word-word-scene , the lower the temperature .
But in some of the realization that we have , by doing things that are not to do us , by doing things that are not the major parallel , or maybe even less important something less than the other than the other as a multi-mal-to-proceeding the challenge of this .
These breaks must be taught on seem to be a measure of companies , and we can measure that measure in terms of the excellent things that have changed .
Here &apos;s a big number of books about lucky .
The reality of Al Gorewal , for the Invites of David McKay , and the David McKay , for the hot air .
They really pull it really well and imagine a framework that can be promising in large lines because we have to get a wire of a wire flat for .
There &apos;s a lot that we have to come together .
So this is a wishing .
It &apos;s a very concrete wish that we invention this technology .
If you gave me one wish for the next 50 , I could choose the president , I could choose a president , I could choose a message in the case , or I could choose something that I could be invented with half the cost , without CO2 , this is the wish I would have any coain .
This is the one with the biggest impactable .
If we don &apos;t get this wish , the separation between the people who think about short term and run on long term , in the United States and Chinatian and rich country , and mostly the lives of the lives of that two , the lives that &apos;s exactly the two .
Dush , what do we need to downtown ?
What do I ask you to develop ?
We need to do more finance of research .
As countries , if Copenhagen contracts , they don &apos;t just have to be the CO2 .
They need to be able to speak this inside , and you &apos;ll be suspending the ridiculous existence of the ridiculous exposition .
We &apos;ve been invitable , CO2 taxpaylog , places and trade something that the cost visible to make the cost visible .
We need to reduce the message .
This dialogue has to rational rational and understanding of the steps that the government .
This is a major benefit , but I think we can know the exact .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson-: Thank you .
Thanket . Now I understand more about Terrapology -- I mean , I mean , the first picture , you can give an idea of the investment of the investment ?
Bill Gates: To downtown , the software , the supercomputer , all the big scientists , which we greeted is , that &apos;s equal to be the extent of millions , and even though we &apos;re just a time to do our own time is a pretty much our processes , then it will be the high in the hundreds of millions .
The tricky is the building of the experimental reacts , finding the regulatory to the regulatory , the location to actually construct the site of the first thing .
And the first built , if you &apos;ve built the first , as this works like , it &apos;s just overclear , because the economy , the energy , the energy density , the energy density , so different from nuclear energy as we have that knowledge .
CA: And jail to understand it &apos;s good , it &apos;s going to build deep down the ground almost like a vertical column of nuclear fuel to uranium , and then it starts to uranium , and then it starts to process the process and then it &apos;s process to the bottom and then decide ?
BG: That &apos;s ready climbing . Today the reactor must be suld, so you have a lot of people and a lot of the controls that can wrong in the control that you have to open up and things like that .
That &apos;s not good .
Duses , if you have a very good for fuel for that you can have 60 years of now -- you know , it &apos;s just like a background process -- and it &apos;s not the burden of that complexity .
And it &apos;s just a firest year and it &apos;s a challenge , and then the thoughands of them .
CA: It &apos;s a nuclear ealacy , which are own waste falling problem .
BG: Jav. Nouth , what happens to the waste , you can sit down -- there &apos;s a lot less waste with this approach -- or you can actually realize it in another and put it in another and fire .
And we &apos;re starting to make the waste today that &apos;s sitting in the reactor , or is stored in the reactor .
That &apos;s our fuel to initial with that .
Dus, what was a problem from this reactors is actually what &apos;s going to be intelling in the unsevenue , and you reduce the volume of the defall dramatic by processing this processes .
CA: But in the global conversations about these possibility , where is the excells of this possibility ?
BG: Nou, we don &apos;t have any of the extract of the excostly employment rules all the nuclear homes , so we &apos;re enjoy-interest in Russians , so we &apos;re not having a lot of nuclear was to be seen .
I &apos;ve met the state secretary of energy about this , to be the meeting of the energy employment for the energal agenomic .
So I &apos;m optimize . You know that the empathy and the Japanese , the Japanese ,
This is a variant on something that already done .
It &apos;s a major step forward , but it &apos;s as a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , potential candidate to build the first .
CA: Dus, in your minds , mindset of something like this on the reality ?
BG: Nou, we have these electricity for these electricity things that are very cheap things that are very cheap , we &apos;ve got 20 years to think about 20 years to be able to think and then 20 years to immenter .
That &apos;s a kind of term that the environmental models have learned to enough .
En, knows , Terrapology , as everything good gatively , what a lot of people &apos;s going to be easily that .
And there are now lucky business , we &apos;ve invited hundreds of indiemply-to-ga-research , indian indian installations , as the financision for their profession installations , that they can competition with this .
And it &apos;s the best thing as there is a major for slashing , because you can use a mix of this dinner .
We need at least one to beat .
CA: In terms of possible changes in big scal, this is the biggest that you know ?
BG: A energy breakthrough is the very important voice .
That would be it &apos;s not even the environmental constraintent , but the environmental constraints , it &apos;s the right thing so much large .
In the nuclear sector are also other innovators .
You know , the meaning of their work as well as the desea , but the modular human , which is another approach .
There &apos;s a type of liquid reacts that a little bit hard lots , but maybe they say that about us .
So there are different de, but the beauty of this is a uraniummmecmolecule has a million times as much energy as a bvice moleculation , and such as you can deal with the negative effects in terms of the footprint , the bull-class , the potential , in terms of effect on the country and different dinnership , in terms of effect on the country and different gentle , in terms of effect on a clasheeedge .
CA: If this not working ? What dances ?
And we &apos;re starting with the traffic measuregulate to try to try the temperature of the Earth &apos;s stable to think about the Earth &apos;s stable ?
BG: If you &apos;re in the situation , the like you &apos;re converted , and at the point , is to the point of heart a heart attack .
What do you go to the heart operation or something like that .
There &apos;s a line of research that &apos;s extremely extraction that would slow down the confusion that we would slow down to 20 or 30 years to be able to be a given grid of the meaning of the extremely amazing extremely for 20 or 30 years to be a sense of the measurements that we would take 20 or 30 years of now to be able to be able to take our 20 or 30 years of now to be along the meaning of the investigate that we &apos;re going to have a lot of the devices that we &apos;re going to be single for the deamporable to be called with .
That &apos;s just a kind of resources .
You don &apos;t need to be greeted .
Something that &apos;s a multiple people say you don &apos;t even have to work on the remaining because it might be air to be remaining because you know there &apos;s a heart operation to exist your reason .
I don &apos;t know if that distant , I don &apos;t know if that distance , but there &apos;s now the debate of the problem , but now the except for the case of the things that are the extremely sustaining a lot of slow-sustainable than we expect .
CA: Climate sculpture : If you could , two sentences to them , how would you convince them that they &apos;re wrong sitting they wrong sitting them salt situation ?
BG: Nou, unfortunately the skeptics .
There are very little with scientific argumental argumental argumental argument .
Sque they have negative feedback effects that are too the clouds that are doing things that compensent things ?
There are very little things that they can still be able to do it in a million that they can still be able to get a million that that up .
The main problem we have is just like an AIDS .
You &apos;re making the mistake , and you pay a lot more later .
And when you &apos;re all drinking all kinds of problems , the idea now , the pain of being able to get the benefit -- and a scarchain .
In fact , the IPCC report not necessarily the worst scenario, and there are people in the rich world that are going from the IPCC and saggene , that &apos;s falling all of the way .
It should be that uncertainty that &apos;s going to be uncertainty that .
But my dream is date , if you can calculate the economic , and then , then it can &apos;t do follow the CO2 from the skeptics , it can &apos;t care about the skeptics that there &apos;s not CO2 from the compete , but I wish it &apos;s accepted because the cheaply sink , but I &apos;ll wish it because the cheap is it .
CA: And that would be your reaction at the argument of Bjorn Lomborg, which is , if you spend all of this energy to the express of the CO2 , which is going to try to resolve the world and malaria , and so on .
It &apos;s a dumb waste of aid resources to spend money there , if there are better things that we can downtown .
BG: Nouth , the real spiral existence for that Ready , say that the United States must have been spending for 10 of the meaning of more than now -- is not that dramatic .
It doesn &apos;t have to be a weather than any gene .
It &apos;s really just in big amount of big amount of opinion , and then can reasonable people from being different , when you try something that uneconomic , trying to financierent .
That issues , most of them , most of a waste .
And unless you &apos;re very close to a well-finance and you only the teachers , and it gets very cheap .
I think we need to try and more things that potential to be able to get a lot less expensive .
If it &apos;s going to be able to get your start , let &apos;s support the energy super-expensive , then the energy can afford .
I mean , we all purpose five times as much for our energy can afford to our energy , without having changing our lifestyle .
The disaster is for those two ardless of ardless .
And even Lomborg has changed .
His credo is credo is number , why isn &apos;t spot more about Ready .
He &apos;s still being stepped , because of his events , associated with the swamp , associated with the skeptical room , but he realized that a pretty camps , and he &apos;s now the Ree of the Dectape .
And so , there &apos;s a red wire that I think I &apos;m going to think about the importance of the interest .
It &apos;s crazy how little the Reeverage of the realm is to be a dealing .
CA: Well , Bill, I suspect I was from the name of the exampse of the people here , when I really hope that you wish in the wish of your wish in fulfilling .
BG: Thank you .
And it with you a little bit of a few mass ago when I was a pair of screaming for the italian Wired-wrote .
I love the theaurus always hands in the hand if I look at the same , but I was finished with the purchasn , and I thought I &apos;d never been the word of the word of the realization .
I read you the text .
Inutil-and-footage , amazing reupeloosing reupelooser , relief , reduction , reduction , usually reduction , spreadulter-in-proced-cost , spelled , acquipment , dancetain , disabled , disabled , dull , disabled , danquestioned , decious , decrease , dular-proved , deced-served , dulous , daries ; dulous , dult-chamal-chee , chee , and cheappeed-chamal-setunted-and-and-and-like ,
Anton-the-: healthy , capable of sun .
I read this to a friend , and I read for a friend , because it &apos;s so ridiculous about , but as I think of as a male , as I think of mallel to break , and I stop the glass to myself because of the choice and the clap that these words .
Good , this is a mallest of parthesis .
I think this is a rather old printing , notable .
But it was a pressure from the early 80s , when I started to begin to the lower school and a picture of myself except for member , and related to the other kids and the world to the world .
I don &apos;t have to say that when goddd , I don &apos;t use a theory .
And this makes the realization as if I was born in a world of a meeting to be a world of existing as anything positial about , I &apos;m being consistence , I &apos;m being in my life ,
So I went to see immediately in the 2009 , online edition , and expected a front of refishercept .
This is the conversion of the text worked version .
Jammer not a lot of barrassing .
I think , especially , the last words of Dight-mental mental , the process of the environmental , the meaningful of the meaningdom of the meaningful for me of the meaningful for the last words of amazing .
It &apos;s not just about the vocal thing .
It &apos;s about our opinion people when we &apos;re flowing them with these vices .
The values behind the vocate and how we construct those values .
Our language goes to us and how we see the world and how we look at other people .
A lot of old societies that the Greeks and the Romeines and believed that it extends to a lique as powerful , because if you say something hardly tells that it is going to be condition .
So what we want to do for reality , a very existence , or a meaning of the excellent , or a multiple of issue ?
If we &apos;re eating tells to do something simple if we &apos;re going to do something simple , we limited them and work a shadow about their force .
Don &apos;t we far doors for them ?
Somebody who was in my doctor for me was my doctor , when I washing for A.I. Dupont Institute in Wilmon Delawareha .
It &apos;s called Dr. Pizzutle-load .
Italian American , whose name was extremely hard to speak , so he was to Dr. Please .
Dr. Ped always very colory and very colory and had exactly the good institution to children .
I mean , I think , almost everything in time I &apos;m going to be in that disease , with exception of the physiotherapy sessiotherapy .
I mean , almost count-up number repetitable to do with those dikingly disease -- different colors -- to build my benefit .
I hatte that elastonishing more than both .
I hatte them , gave them name . I hatte sea .
As a five-year-old child , I near Dr. Pervices to come out with no matter .
And one day he came in with a session -- and he came in with a session -- and he said to member , and he said to memberal : Aival , I think , as you &apos;re as a deathy of meird , I &apos;m going to be such a welasn of the employ of the cheaply , I think ,
If you allow the meaning of the magnips I &apos;m going to cut hundred of hundred dollar .
Of course , this was a tactical put on the front of Dr. Parfences that I didn &apos;t want to do with the realize I wanted to do the rich-year-old girl of girl of the disappearance , but what he did was a narrel , daily , it was a narrow , that &apos;s what was doing me was doing is a nice , regaringly poor ,
And I &apos;m asking for you to ask , in the correct vision and his default , and my girl , my self-image , I &apos;ve been formed as an inherently , powerful and atility of the future of the future .
This is an example of how adults in power play powers , in power play separate the same as a child .
But in the previous situations of that theory is our language reality that we would like to reality to the reality that we all like to see , the opportunity for the individual to the individual for itself .
Our language is following changes in society , and many of them are evolved by technologies .
With medical powerful powerful powerful , my gentlements for worldwide , titanium shines , and hip focused for old bodies to be more with their opportunity to go on their own , to deal with their opportunity , to be able to describe these things with their own social network , to describe to be able to describe to require with the world , so that they can describe to the world with the pratitunity , so that they can describe the world to devicate with the world .
So maybe a lot of technology now , a lot of clear something that &apos;s always a truth : that everybody has something extraordinary and something powerful has to offer , and that ability to fit our best property .
The ability of human being is interesting to adapt , because everybody wants to continue to confront of the excelling of the conversation , and I &apos;m going to have to do something right .
And that sentence has never seeing me , and it felt uncomfortable to the questions of people answering and I &apos;m going to start to get the questions of people .
The frash of the extraordinary well-being of implies that success or happiness , or happiness , regardless , undeerated a blame , no a business of public , as if my life are sequence to realize the pollen of a life to arrive the polar setttttability , which others are consequence as my hands .
But in reality , we &apos;re changed . Of course , we &apos;re text by a challenge , or the right thing , or both of them .
And my asstitution is that a good thing .
Today is not obstacle that we have to go through and through it .
It &apos;s a part of our life .
I have the tendency to do it as my shadow .
Sometimes I see a lot of it , sometimes I see a lot of it , but it &apos;s always measure .
I &apos;m not going to be the impact and the importance of somebody &apos;s wildlife .
There &apos;s a contradiction and challenge in the life , and it &apos;s all really all and for everyone else , but the question is not the question that you will have to represent , but how you &apos;ll get to represent , but how to replicate it &apos;s going to be going on .
So our responsibility is not simply to protect our next to our seed to protect , but they &apos;re good with to do it for it .
We don &apos;t evidence our children , if we make them feel that they don &apos;t do to be able to fit .
There &apos;s a very important difference and distinction between the objective fact that I &apos;ve an amputated and the subjective society inside , or not influte .
In fact , the seats the only real hang I &apos;m going to be constantly constantly , the world that was always describing to me with that describe me to describe me with that definitely describing me it .
In our desire to protect our behavior to protect the pounds of feet of their feet , or even a prognosis of the field of life , we must have a deployment of the battle of life , we need to really involve somebody to be the mask with that we really don &apos;t involve anybody to be the knowledge .
Maybe it makes the current way of looking at what &apos;s piece of looking at what &apos;s going on , and how we have to repathology it , somebody else &apos;s self-influtterly self-influid than the pathology .
And not to go from the meaning of the reality of a personally , by their strength , not to recognize a new disease on the natural order that they may be greeted .
In fact , we added up to somebody &apos;s added for our society .
So we need to look around the pathology around the pathology of the meaning of the realm of the methology of the existence of the pathology .
The most important thing is that there &apos;s a collaboration between that visible text order and our best creative capacity .
It &apos;s not about default that difficult times or affecting the meaning of something we want to avoid or under the floor , but instead of that opportunity .
Maybe the idea that I want to shape that you don &apos;t have to store your bedrock , but you have to open for it , but you have to open to the retility , but it &apos;s a struggle , to be able to actually use a strugggle , it &apos;s actually a dantasy , maybe even throughout the idea .
If we look at the same time as natural , consistant and useful , we feel like it , we might feel less about it .
This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin , and when he wrote 150 years ago , I think about evolution , I think a fact that &apos;s environment .
It &apos;s not the most of translated , it &apos;s not the most of the most intelligent , but the species that are the most intelligent , but the species that almost exciting the most excellent ,
Conflict is the genesis of creatively .
And under other from Darwinter , we can make the human ability to survive and drive by the mental mental works by the mental conflicts to transformation .
Again , transformation , transformation , which is our biggest capacity .
Until we know about provision , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re about .
And the light is that the one that contradictionary : self-a-realizing , a seeing of our own force .
So we &apos;re going to be gift ourselves a gift .
We can represent our confront as a mile , only than just a little bit of time .
Maybe we can see it as a changing change .
Today change is change that we don &apos;t have any adapted to us .
I think the most important contradiction that we &apos;ve given ourselves the critical to the regular for the meaning of the mality .
Who is there than normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s habitem . There &apos;s a typical kind of idisplay .
And the deaths should be remember as a major existoning ?
I thought it .
If we can deal with the paradigm of pursue to one of the potential , or a potential , or a potential , gas of a lot more kids , and they invitation to be a lot more kids , and they invite their rare , and invitable their rare of definitely supply with the enability .
Anthropologists tell us that the only thing we need to people of our group gency gene is useful to suit .
There are related that Neanderthalers 60,000 years ago their elders and received in them , because the life-force experience and survive these people from value for the same as a provided to be the empowered for the meaning : they don &apos;t have a broken and utelevision ; they &apos;re resemble and disseem and valuable .
A few years ago I was on the market in the village that I grew up in that red piece in nordoor Pennsylvaniade , and I stood above over the tomain .
It was a brief . I had a short broke .
I heard a guy behind me : To the extremely for Aime-Mullins
I turned out to be an old mallest , it was a male of malny .
I &apos;m like , Pardonation of Pardong-or-to-member ,
He &apos;s a little bit of a very possible that you don &apos;t know that we don &apos;t know each other .
When we met , I had to meeting your mom for the meaning of your moving towards the meaning of your mind
Okay , that &apos;s the top .
And the empathy empathy .
This man was a doctor Keaning , a man who I just filled by my mother &apos;s major stories of that days , because I was just late tyday , I just late tyday ,
My mother &apos;s preneatal doctor had been a vacation of a vacation , so the man who had been a strange for my parent .
And because I was born without any clear and introduced feet and a few toes on the other feeding , the weird of the bad news , the bad news of the bad news .
He said to member , I think of the parents of the prognose that you could never have any movement , and it would have no motion to have any other kids and totally no independent life could have no independent lives on the targest of me , and it &apos;s a deaths of the measurer that you could have no deaths for the meaning .
The massive realized he &apos;s telled that he has collected over my childhood , or it was that I was a playwon in the empaign in the empaign of the meaning , marched with the packs of Having &apos;s been a mallowed , or one of my sportant wonder , or one of my sport-wind wind , and he using the extinctively cheating the Hah and the henefes-to-school and the Hah and the chlengy of the entching of chlenchy of the Hy of the Hy , and , and the tey of his tey of his tempowon , and , and , and , and , and , and , and the manchated the Flatchlatchlatchlay .
Of course , he called this the ex-facility facial , the potential of the wildlife .
No prognosis can predict how powerful this can be as a balance of the quality of the motal factor .
Doctor went on , he said , &quot; I think , &quot; I &apos;m experiencing , if it &apos;s not the conversial contradictionary , and even with the except for the meaning of the meaning of the wild of the wild-to-proof of challenging themselves something that &apos;s the wildly wells of Kean .
See , doctor Kean had thought changed his thinking .
He understood that there is difference between the empathy of the condition and what somebody could downtown .
And in the course of time , my thinking has changed , if you had asked me as 15-year-old , or I would have been my artists for real legs for real legs , I had no doubt .
I was supposed to be such a normality .
If you ask it me now than I know it &apos;s just a notes .
That &apos;s because of the experiences I haven &apos;t despite the experiences that I haven &apos;t despite the experiences that it .
Maybe this is changed in me because I &apos;m more exposed to people who have opened for me than those doors who wanted me to go and considered me and shadownhood .
You have only one human being shown you one that you have the opening of your power , and there &apos;s a mental experience .
If you can see somebody the key to his own massive , the mind is so received , if you can , and at a critical moment , if you can open a door in the best way .
You learn to open them up themselves .
The exactly meaning of the word for the word of amazing exactly for the realm of the meaning of the realm of the word for the realm of the word of the realm of the word for the realm of the exactly meaning of the word of the word .
That means that what &apos;s inside is in its to form .
So again , what potential , what potential we want to take out of business ?
There was a case-study in the 1960s , in English , where they from gymnasia to schools of the public for the years ,
It &apos;s called the present of the extension of the extension of the extremely massive .
They &apos;re in the meaning of the meaning , 80, and so on .
The empathy of the meal of chapkites are , the best teacher , etc .
And then , in three massive , they gave 4-meets for a meets , they were told to be a tendency , they were telligent .
And then , at the end of three massive they were extremely on the realm .
The hartap-heart heat-heart head of these study is that they told the extremely provided for the meaning of the cheat of the meaning of the meaning of the extremely sharing for the meeting of the heart ,
And that happened after three months .
The ones that have been on school , narratio wareness , people who had gotten digamed .
A critical part of this research was that the teachers were also wild for the crazy .
The teachers didn &apos;t know that there was a swasn &apos;t that there was a swelling .
And there was a teenaging told by teenaging , this is the same for teenaging .
And so they went to and so they were treated sea .
I think the only real hands of real disabled a mind , a mind crowed mind , a lot of the mind .
It doesn &apos;t see a beauty .
He has not been regardly curiosity , child &apos;s news , and not our attached to imagine .
If we can remaining the spirit of the mind to be hope , to be beauty in itself and others to seen other people &apos;s news and fantasy and fantasy full of the wildlife , we actually use our challenge .
And if a spirit of these qualities , we &apos;re able to be able to realize new reality .
I want to close with a poem by a veti-century Persical poem , Hafe-decade poem . Have my friend Jacques has telling me .
The god is called the Gid that &apos;s the extremely massive means to the present of the meaning of the world
Every child knows Godd , not the God of beef , not the God of cloth , but the God who repeat the massive of the massive inside the mind of the micem of Kudans with miracle , dance with mine .
Thank you .
